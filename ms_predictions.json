I look around and I wonder why do I continue to fight the fight when suicide sounds so much easier and free. I would not have to be alone anymore, I would not have to be a burden to society, I would not have to be hurt or in pain by all those who have hurt me in the past, I would not have to be depressed anymore, and I would not have to pretend I care I could just be free and finally happy. Every day it is just a cycle of waking up, going to work, going to school and then going to sleep I wake up and do it all over again it's endless and mindnumbing. I should be grateful that I have a roof over my head, a car, about to graduate from college, and that I have a nice job but I don't care not one bit why should I when I am completely alone, I have no friends, no family....nothing. I am just tired and sick of life all the time, I just want to stay in bed all day and never wake up some days are better than others but most days suicide is always on my mind, I constantly think about the endless ways that I can kill myself, but deep down I know that I don't have the guts to do it but I still think about it constantly. I just fear of ending up like my mother an angry bitter old woman who is abusive to everyone including her kids and always has a negative outlook on life thus repeating the cycle of abuse. I just feel broken and like no one can fix me because there is nothing to fix when there isn't anything inside me anymore.",

      "text": "Surpassed 2017 Reading Challenge: 52 books. I began this year with a goal of reading fifty-two books. This was... quite ambitious for me, given that in the previous year I read a grand total of two books. At the beginning of the year, it seemed I was never going to finish the challenge—by week nine, I had only read two books. It was only in March that I really got serious about my goal. Unfortunately, my reading dropped off at the beginning of the summer, but it luckily picked back up again by the time the new school year started. I now read roughly five hours every day (5 AM - 7 AM before classes and 7 PM - 10 PM before I fall asleep) and intend to continue reading a large number of books next year. If I had to offer advice to anyone planning on undertaking this challenge, it would be this: find more time to read.Without further ado, here are the fifty-eight books I read this year in chronological order.An explanation of my rating system follows. Please note that the system is entirely subjective to how much I enjoyed the book, and not an objective measure of the books literary value or how well the work was written. The rating is based entirely on my opinion.",

So I went there, past 2am, with my rope to end this misery. But upon arriving, I've noticed that the path leading to the place I was heading to was not lit by street lamps. Already gave me a bad vibe, but okay, time to turn on the torchlight on my phone. After a few metres in, I got spooked really bad by a tree I mistook for some slendermanesque man, and after catching my breath, by some animal in the bushes. That was to much for me, so I went back home. Everything seemed so unreal, like a real life psychedelic horror movie until I got back home. I'm a bit dissappointed with myself, as killing myself would be the best way out of my misery. But it's not really easy, if the sorrow and neuroticism that consumes you transfers into your suicide plans and makes you fear failure to off yourself on the first try. I'm not even depressed or feeling sad right now, I'm in a pretty neutral state of mind. But thinking about myself, suicide seems like the logical thing to do. I will now read into death by exsanguination, as for my bathroom is lit even at night.",

I don't know if it's because I'm too scared or if I don't want to bother anyone more than I already have. It's gotten to the point where my flaws get in the way of everyone else. My social awkwardness scares people away and if they do try to talk to me, I accidentally puck them away to avoid saying anything stupid. I've been hiding my Autism behind a shy, emotionless persona to avoid looking like a weirdo. I would end up looking like a weirdo either way. My thoughts are telling me that \"it's better to be shy and normal rather than myself and weird\". I want to break free but don't know where to start and I don't want to lose the few friends I have because of this secret. I have a visual impairment which has left me looking unattractive and unapproachable. I can't see or experience the world like a normal person but I WANT to. I just can't. My younger sister and everyone in her Year treats me like shit (and I don't blame them). I've been nicknamed, shamed on social media and have them talk about me. Plus from my sister (who I have no way of moving away from) I deal with her mental and physical abuse everyday. I take the blamed for things that \"my brother did\" in order to protect him. My parents think it's just sibling rivalry but I think there's more to it.There are only two people in my irl life that I would consider telling about my thoughts but one of them I don't want them worrying about me (they get panicked easily). The other person although I get along with them well and he's trying to help me build my confidence, they are a crush that will be nothing more than that. He's so \"up there\" in school compared to me. He's smart, funny and confident. I'm none of those things and I would just be an annoying person holding him back from having fun.I spent the last two years trying to improve my social skills and my confidence. Despite trying everything I'm now throwing the towel and giving up. I don't care what happens to me at this point. I had goals, dream and ideas. Now I don't see any of it happening.",

There's just so much more I'd rather read right now and well into the future, too. However, as far as scratching the itch for an autumnal dose of horror? The movie would suffice.This makes me feel vaguely guilty, though. I don't encourage spurning literature in favour of a film -- as a shortcut or a disregarding of the product of one medium over that of another -- and that's not what I'm trying to do. In this case, it's just a matter of interest level and time. I'm interested enough to see the film, but not to read the book. Is my guilt over this warranted? I don't know. Maybe I should just hold off on the movie until I whittle my queue down and can read King's book.",

      "text": "My current Situation... If you don't mind reading it would help very much. But here is my current situation right now... So to start off, I am in college working a part time job (that I absolutely hate) at a restaurant. I was usually the nice, quiet, hardworking one, but I have been there for two miserable years. My attitude towards people in general has spiraled downward all because I have seen cheap people who don't tip or tip so little that many like myself cant make decent money to pay for school. I work with former thugs, drug addicts and people who just had lots of bad luck to where they are stuck needing to work at a restaurant where they make less than minimum wage. For myself I make $5 an hour including an uncertain amount of money in tips. Sometimes its higher, most times its relatively low. When I show up to work, which is two 5-6 hour shifts every weekend, I usually ignore my main boss. Im afraid of him. All he cares about is the status quo. He essentially makes the servers lie and market themselves in such a fashion that the servers purpose is to make people sell things to people that they dont need or want. Im a busser, so normally I dont interact with customers, but sometimes I really get depressed, especially when I see my friends from a catholic high school I went to show up in my restaurant. The reuniting of two former high school classmates in a situation like that can be awkward. Almost all of them that I have talked to are married, have their degrees and because of their degree, have great jobs. Its been 5 years since I left high school and it really seems like they have their lives in order. From the looks of it, they sound free and at peace. I however, still live with my parents. My father keeps asking how much longer I have until I'm done with college. This also depresses me because he never went to college let alone graduate high school. I feel he can never ever understand the amount of struggling and painful sacrifice I have made to my mind and body to get ever closer to a Computer Science degree. I have taken classes that I have done well in. Some I have had to retake. But the ones I retake, especially the senior level classes are only offered one semester out of the entire year. This means, you either understand it in the time frame its allowed or you don't. Don't get it? Well tough luck. Try again next time. There goes about $1000 dollars down the drain. When I explain this to my father he nags at me because he thinks I am lazy. I cry on the inside because I cant seem to explain to my dad my points to him whenever he asks how long I have until I am done with college. My mother is the only one who even comes close to understanding this. She went to college, although it was for business administration. Shes worked and put up with public school education for 26 years and retires next year. She also doesn't seem to understand how hard my major is at least for me. She wont let me take it at my own steady pace so that I wont be overwhelmed with things to cram for an exam. I also have a girlfriend who I love. We have dated for 4 years. In fact we just celebrated our anniversary last month. I almost cried in bitter anger when I realized that she had a Trichotillomaniac moment and cut off all her hair off. All I remember feeling was... I have held on with her mental habit for 4 years. We had worked so hard together to let her natural hair take over from all that suffering she went through. Now its starting all over. I almost dumped her. She wears a wig everywhere we go and when someone comments on how pretty her hair looks, I feel so tempted to say that its not real. I am afraid that if my father knew about it he would cause my girlfriend a lot of pain. In terms of suicide I am not really there. But some days I feel so depressed I don't wanna get out of bed. There is such a stigma against people talking about depression because of the modern way we see mental illness. I could never say to my parents that I am depressed because they will just tell me to \"tough it up\" or \"thats life\" or god forbid send me off to a psychiatrist like there is something so wrong with me that Ill be shunned from my family or viewed as weak. The only ally I feel sometimes gets me is my cat. He just shows purrfect love to me and everyone else in the house. He licks my fingers and toes. He even lets me hold him like a baby. Then he will just stare at me with his one eye, like the whole universe, for that moment is at peace. Finally, sometimes I do zen meditation and do yoga to try and recognize why I sometimes get depressed. I try to do with with the intention of practicing letting go and to realize that there are others out there who are in similar situations like my own. Maybe not exactly but close. I wanna hear your guys experiences. Just post them here. I will be supportive just as much as Reddit allows a community to allow discussions about topics like this.",

I'll be clear if I commit suicide you'll never read a post asking for help from me it will just be done and over. death doesn't frightening me I just feel I'm still have a chance to give the world something positive. With that being said I want to share a brief summary of my life so some of you might not repeat my mistakes or at least realize your actions have reactions. When I was young I had such a fire in me for life I was happy and full of opportunity. Through things such as group beatings molestation and being general used as human toilet paper I lost my fire. By the time I was a teenager I started using drugs. It gave me an escape and \"friends\". Even though I was developing substance abuse problems I also lived weight lifting and became a national powerlifting champion and had a beautiful girlfriend. Early in my twenties I lost my girlfriend and wrecked a car. I was put on pain killers and around the same time had started selling volume amounts of weed and cocaine. Pain killers became my everything and my business dealings allowed me a unimaginable habit. Eventually my habit over took all and I couldn't keep my professional life together. I lost my connections and my morals one by one . All my so called friends were gone along with my money but my habit persisted. Eventually what was left of me was a needle junkie living for the high and doing anything to get it. Time kept moving and the hamster wheel kept spinning. Then I had kids and decided I wanted to change. So I got into a methadone clinic and cleaned up. I did fairly well most if the time but never really lost my desire to use. About a month and a half ago. I had a succession if bad shit happen to me in rapid order. So I decided to run back to my old friend except this time on the trip back I must have fallen asleep and head on hit a 73 year old grandmother's car killing her instantly.Now I have to deal with two massively broke legs a heart ready to burst with grief and sadness and the knowledge I'll soon be leaving my family for prison and to tell you the truth I don't know if I will go on that trip. I really hope that if some young people read this shortened simplified account of my life they may realize that what there dealing with isn't that bad and to hold on. Also I want people to realize just how life altering a decision to use drugs can be and how much of a monster opiates are.Thank you for reading and God bless",

I feel like I could have at many points before, but now it feels like I have truly reached the end and there is nowhere else to go.It has been a long fucking year. 2017 in general has been but I've attempted suicide twice in the last 12 months. Last October was a very serious attempt, and then in April was a half assed attempt where I took a bunch of pills and then threw them up shortly after.I'm 27 now and while I have been dealing with depression and extreme highs/lows all my life, it has always been very fleeting. I'd have a few days of crying and then it'd go away. Well it wouldn't go away, but it'd be in the back of my mind and I'd move on and stuff. I was also never considering suicide at those points no matter how hopeless I was. It was something I thought about for sure, but at the time I never gave it serious thought.In February I had some things happen to me that triggered a full blown depression. For 2.5 months, til mid-April, I was crying almost every day, stopped talking to many people, and didn't do much of anything. It was bad. For most of it I was only considering suicide half the time, and after my attempt in April I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't go through with another serious attempt until I tried everything possible to improve my life.Well here I am. I'm literally failing at what is my last resort in life. I've always had another path to take but I am seriously out of options now. This was the end of the line. The only thing going right for me is that I am living in my ideal city. Everything else I am failing at.27 years old now and every attempt I have made to change things has failed miserably. I try to make things better but it only results in making things worse. These last few months my goals have to been to rebuild my life here in this city that I love but so much has gone wrong in the process.I honestly don't know how much longer I will make it. Days or weeks. My hole keeps getting deeper and deeper. My intention was to reverse all this by winter but things have gone wrong so fast that I don't know how they got here.And I am slowly beginning to feel like I did in February.

I take my medication regularly I have been on the highest doses time and time again and I feel happy but then it all drains away. I keep taking my medications in the one instance where I finally will feel like it works but it doesn’t and I’m stuck living this emotional toll. I think of killing myself increasingly everyday so much so that I started thinking about doing it at work. I normally can take being happy at work but now I just feel drained and can’t even concentrate. It gets so bad that every morning I wake up put my gun to my head and just think one pull would end it all. But I have my dog that I love that I refuse to leave to anyone else. I was in the Army for 3 years and developed crippling depression and anxiety and haven’t started anything at the VA because I’m scared to be denied and believe that The process is so hard. I don’t leave my house, I don’t have hobbies I just sit at home all day with my dog and rot. This is really the final cry for help I can think of. I don’t know that I’ll really make it through the night.",

      "text": "Is it worth to kill myself Brief background on me: I'm 15 this year, and suffer from depression. I have a dark history with 'family and friends' and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Life's been a bitch to me, my studies have gone haywire, I'm losing friends and I think too much about murder and suicide. I feel that suicide while bringing someone down with me is my only way out. Help.If it helps, I live life without a care anymore. Since life is a bitch to me, might as well don't give it any more chances.Edit: Since i have nothing to lose, might as well leave my life story here.I was a very well behaved kid from age 1-6. Then it all changed. My most beloved grandmother passed, and my mother, with no parenting experience took over after quitting her job. From Primary 1-6 (7-12), it wasn't fun. I was beaten and kicked out of the house for even just a small mistake. Back then my studies were fairly decent, averaging As on my tests. Bullying was a major problem, being shoved around, called names, hurt physically and emotionally. Seconday School rolls along. I'm fucked, I can't keep up in school, I'm simply starting to be ostracized. I feel helpless. Now I'm Secondary 3(15), today I'm accused of being a stalker, I'm getting blocked, and time is running out. My murderous mind is going crazy, I nearly leapt today. Close friend stopped me. One day I'm gonna be outta friends. That is when I know I'm a definite goner. Please. Help me for god's sake.",

A never ending cycle of feeling a little better and then wanting to jump out a window. It's exhausting. I'm physically emotionally and mentally drained all the time and I just want to be done. It's not going to get better I've been told it will and so I've hung on this long but in reality I know it won't. I'm just so tired. The thing that makes me smile the most is when I think about pulling the trigger. How it will finally all be over. No more waking up to nothing. No more insomnia. No more crying alone in the corner of my bedroom. No more disappointing anyone. No more saying the wrong thing. No more looking ugly and most importantly no more of the feeling of emptiness that can't be filled. It leaves for a little when I have a distraction but it comes back five seconds later. I HATE IT. I'm just so done. I want to die. I'm so tired of crying. I'm exhausted. It's time to go. The biggest problem though is im too afraid. I tell myself it doesn't matter I'm going to die anyway but I'm too afraid of the unknown. If I stay alive atleast I know what to expect. Pure fucking shit. But atleast shit is better than nothingness. Or maybe it isn't. That's the thing I wouldn't know if it was worse or better because the unknown. I want to go but I'm too afraid. I also currently have no access to a gun. That's the only way I'll attempt. Least chance of failure. Anyone know how to get a gun unlawfully and/or the best way to get over a fear of death?

I also find a thread to talk myself out of it. I feel alone. There is no one there. No one to talk too. I have to carry the world and if I misstep then it is others who take the pain. My wife tries to help, be there, be understanding. I just don't know how to relay to her what is broken in me. I changed jobs the feelings are worse now I feel worthless in the professional side of it too. It wasn't always this way. I used to be able to sleep more than an hour or two at a time. I used to be able to turn off my inner monologue. Now I just feel it screaming at me all the time. I've got two small children that need everything. They are the reason I stop. Even this morning the voice of doubt is in my head but the thought of my wife explaining it to my kids pulled me back. I used to think I could take on the world now I have to pep talk myself to get out of bed. It's pathetic. Part of me thinks maybe it is CTE. I played enough to allow for that to be a possibility but in the end it it is just me. I don't want to be here, the world wouldn't care if I wasn't(not that it should) and I keep fighting because I don't want to hurt my kids.

      "text": "The harder I try the further I fall. I was diagnosed with chronic depression pretty early on, I think around 12 or 13. Diagnosed with bipolar when I was 19, and BPD when I was about 24. And PTSD about a year ago. I am now about to be 29 in a few weeks and I have been stuck in the worst depression of my life since this past December. I had been In a depression before that but I’d come out of it within days. I can’t come out of it this time. Its been almost 10 months! I don’t have the desire or will to live anymore. No I do not want to kill myself nor do I have a plan. but it’s like my brain has become hardwired to just constantly obsess about suicide. It’s almost like I welcome the darkness lately. I haven’t even been able to get into a manic state in probably a year. This is detrimental to me. I could paint and make the art I love to make when I am manic. My artwork was my outlet and I’ve lost that spark. I actually felt happy, and content. I actually live my life and get shit done. With my depression comes the most god awful anxiety I’ve ever experienced. It’s crippling, and it affects my home, relationships and work life. I’ve tried multiple medications and they only make things worse. I actually got started on a new one today. Basically the reason I am writing this is because today.. I have been in the worst place mentally than I think I’ve ever been. I lost it today. I had to move in with my family last December after my breakup, I was suppose to be getting money saved and bills paid off. My depression kept me from doing that. Well, now, as of four weeks ago today my checks began to get garnished by a hospital here in town for thousands of dollars. Well, Today I get a summons for court because that same hospital is suing me again for another bill that is thousands of dollars more than the garnishment happening right now. And about a week ago I get a letter from the IRS stating I’m being put on a levy or pay 500$ immediately. And then find out my car has an issue that needs addressed immediately before the axel breaks and that could cost around 600-800$ I’ve been struggling living paycheck to paycheck so I had no savings and I literally got paid today and have less than 20$ to last’s me another two weeks. I’m trying like hell but the harder I get pummeled the more I want to give up. I know I am strong and I know I am capable of shit I can’t even imagine but I’m reaching my breaking point. My body is small, it can only take so much. The constant self hate and self destructive behaviors destroy me. It’s like I won’t allow myself to be happy. I feel like that “happy” feeling doesn’t exist inside me anymore. Why are we so frowned upon when we want to end our pain and suffering? I get that people will be hurt by it and miss us but staying is torture. I can’t even enjoy being around family and friends because I’m so lost in my head. My anxiety causes me to panic and then Everyone thinks that I am upset. I ruin people’s good vibes when I bring my bad vibes around. So we are expected to stay and be miserable and horribly pained just so they won’t feel the sting from us going elsewhere. Isn’t it selfish on both ends? I don’t want to exist in this world but I don’t want to die. Suicide haunts my mind and we are becoming a little too comfortable with each other. “I am strong, but I am tired”",

Everyday, again and again. If I'm just crazy, it's damned persistent.Everything I see online, and at work, tells me that the Trans community will never be accepted. Feminists see us as men, and don't want us anywhere near them. Lesbians see us as Men. (And I'm attracted to girls, lucky me! /s) Men just see us as gay. Gay guys want to drop the \"T\" from LGBT altogether.The only treatment for being Transgender is to transition. But as I'm constantly reminded, that won't make me a \"real\" woman. So what's the point?And so this is why I want to kill myself. It's become increasingly obvious to me that Trannies have no place in this world. I have no place in this world.

      "text": "Background: this isn't my first rodeo. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and 14 years later they're coming up again, louder than ever.When I heard about Chester Bennington and his history of abuse I learned that we were victimized at the same ages. His music was life support when I was young, and I can't shake the idea that this is just what happens when your life was too hard to deal with as a kid. I have 3 degrees in psychology but still can't get this to stop. And really that's all I want at this point, not to be stuck in this body and mind anymore.I lost my job due to depression, lost my partner for similar reasons, survived a car crash but it fucked with my brain, and that's just the past 2 years. I haven't been able to pick myself up and find a life worth living. Instead I keep treading water. No matter how many job apps I put out or plans I make for the future, it doesn't pan out. It feels like the end of the road, and all I want is an end to the suffering.Tomorrow I'm going to a show to see one of my favorite bands. I've been using this show as a reason to hang on for the past couple months - it's silly, but it's been working. But when it's over, there's not a whole lot else to keep me here and I figure if I'm still unhappy at the end of the night then what the hell is the point of holding on.If it comes to that tomorrow night, I'm going to try hanging myself with a bedsheet slip knotted to the doorknob, thrown over top and slip knotted again around the neck. I've gotten into the set-up before just to see if it would hold and it does. I worry about my cat since it's just me and her and I don't want to cause her pain not having her owner around (she's very attached). But in the end it's either going to be her or me who goes first...it's inevitable. I don't know why I'm telling you any of this. I'm just so alone and it would be good to feel heard, I guess.",

      "text": "They never asked about the knife I go by the name gilligan ( a favorite character from a book I like ) Im 23 I like think that im slim fit. Basic work out everyday, I like to fix things that are broken say it maybe a broken electric fan ill have myself electrocuted if I need to just to fix that thing or cut my fingers reparing a broken vase. My latest project was a laptop that my cousin bought for around 100k pesos (ph ) took me three days the power wasnt circulating properly and not turning the damned thing on. After a few frustrating days of sitting fown and experimenting I finally got the thing back alive. It felt like I just revived a person with my hands. It felt good. I dont sleep very often. Having an hour of nap or two maybe 3 would be grand for me. Most of the time im just on my social feeds just staring at animal photos. That cheers me up always. I always have these \" thoughts \" Say a girl says I look handsome its always followed by a voice saying she probably needs something from me or maybe someone gives me something as a gift automatically think that now I owe him . Trust? Its not in my dictionary. These past months just pushed that word away from me farther. I had a girlfriend that promised me that shed never let go. You know what happened. I had a bestfriend of 15 years Yeah we had up and downs. Before then I thought those downs were already settled. During the last weeks of my relationship my bestfriend told my girlfriend that he loves her. That basically came to me as a fucking tsunami againdt a small fishing boat. It all came crashing down after. She broke up with me claiming that Im in the way of her studies. Even tho im always been supportive in all possible ways when shes stressed about anything study related. I make sure Im always there when shit goes down. And I know I did a good job. I am not a happy person. I have these momentary mental breakdowns Like waves of negative thoughrs pulsates through the layers of my mind. I have no way of dealing with it except just being quiet and let it pass through like rain to a sunny day. Or a mist to a mountain. One night we three, me my gf and my bestfriend were hanging on the rooftop of my gf's condo just chilling yalking about stuff. And I had a fucking meltdown. I didnt realize its been 2 hours and ive just been staring at a fucking plant. Then when I woke up I just wanted to cry. I was crying on the inside. But on the outside I just smiled and excused myself saying I felt sick and wanted to go home. My bestfriend responds with alright I gotta go too. So yeah expecting them to head their own ways. I went home too with proper goodbyes and apologies. I spent another 3 hours staring at the ceiling of my room. After crying myself to sleep. 3 am. I went out to look for food. Theres this 24/7 place near a bus top that night commuters take. And there I saw the two. Seemed like gf was walking my bestfriend to the bus stop. They seemed very surprised to see me. I didnt even speak. I just walked past them and kept to myself. My mind was all over the place. I knew what was going on but I was hoping I was wrong. My gf kept calling me. Asking whats wrong and saying how rude of me to ignore them like that. I just made up an excuse that she easily accepted then things were as if nothing happened. Bf started talking to gf about my \" issues \" At this point I just tell myself just let it fix itself. And me being hopefull and wishing things would be different I let go of what happened. But I always get reminded with the fact that they talk more often than I do with my gf. My bf excessively gives more gifts to my gf. And seems to appreciate him more often that she does to me. The thoughts they pile up. But always, I always find the strength to push them away after all. They're only \"thoughts \" or \" intrusive thoughts as my gf calls it. \" After work I head to a net cafe to steam off. I receive a text that me and my gf needs to talk. Then I broke down. The person thats been slowly building me up and the foundation of my progress is about to let me go. So I asked are you gonna break up with me? \" im sorrry. \" I wouldnt take it anymore. I lost it. I went home got a kitchen knife Laid on my bed I lay on my stomach elevating my chest off the bed just so the knife ( handle to the bed the blade to my chest ) fits for 2 hours I was on a death plank. Quiet. No crying. Just blankly staring back into my pillows while my elbows supported my weight. After that. I just found myself drink 3 sleeping pills. The next day I didnt get off my bed. I couldnt eat or drink anything. I had no energy. My throat was dry. My stomach was grumbling. This went on for a full week. Then I started to cut my wrists again. Something ive stopped doing. The last scar I had was from 2009. This was when my parents were throwing ceramic plates at each other like they were trying to make them fly like ufos. My cousins sends me a message \" yo I need help with my thesis \" I felt like I have a purpose again. So I gave everything I had into the new project. I was temporarily happy. I forgot about the small cut on my chest. Which have just recently stopped bleeding. And the cuts on my wrist started to dry up. Just perfectly covered by my watch. I can still feel the sting of when my sweat touches the wounds. Ive convinced myself not to care about what happened anymore..Thanks my cousin says for sure anytime I reply. After that hes graduated from college Congrats We start to hang out more often. But no I dont feel that I have a new friend. Im just that guy they call if they have no choice.They live in a nice quiet villageI took a long ass walk at 1 am I realized I can try harder to be better. A second chance. I opened myself up to new people I met this korean dude named alaycia And noji. The other is recklessly childish and the other is slyly gay aleays hinting sexual stuff towards me. But theyre cool nonetheless. This gal ive been following on one of my social medias. I saw her promoting a desktop tower. Her smile stuck with me. Ever since I saw it ive always brought it with me then. I happen to come across a familair face on fb. It was her. \" Scarlett \" A few days was the length of my wait to finally message her and cope up the bravery to start a conversation with. Little to one word replies. This goes on for days and weeks Ive given up. Shes not interested. But why? One I am a stranger. Two who the fuck am I. 3 I dont need to pull another soul to suffer with me. But I wont do anythi g to harm her. I want to get to know her. If I could. I want to be close to her. Days of emptiness were broken by \" hey im sorry ive just been busy lately \" My heart, you fucking have no idea. My heart. I almost had a heart attack. Thank you for letting me know. Its fine let me know when youre not busy :) I dont mind. Trying to be cool. We continue to talk through the night. I want to hug her. Please care for me like you dont want to lose me. Tbc.",

      "text": "Hi, I posted here a month ago, things gotten better after that but now shit is coming back. Im 19 years old, failed to pass high school for 2 years and now following a program for adults. I regret alot these days, telling me how I could have gotten out of school with a diploma 2 years ago if studied properly. I set my sight on a college I wanted to apply after I highschool but now I'm stuck at this program for 2 more years. The regret builds up, I read about going to college at the age of 21 is normal but thinking of spending 2 years here just make me depressed. People I know, acquantainces even people I call friends are studying at univerisity or higher education. And by the time I get out of school, others are already graduated. It makes me feel pitiful. I have to wake up at 6 every day to take buses. Winter is coming and its a struggle to get up. I find its hard to get motivated to study. I get home late everyday, home is not soothing either. I met old classmates today and talked to them. They said they were at university makes me feel super bad to look at them and keep up the with conversation. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to study and get good grades so that I can get out asap. But the thoughts of being kept there for 2 years makes the study unmotivating. I feel tired, this is my last chance at school, if I fcked this up even my first year, I'm done for, mentally and physically. Going to school keeps making me think about mistakes I made in the past and I feel angry with myself all the time. Please talk to me, enlighten me, guide me, I really feel a big burden of the past mistakes and the upcoming challenges.",

      "text": "Feeling really alone and everything in my life is sucking Hi everyone. I have had a particularly rough life but the past couple of years have been very hard on me. I have thought about suicide for a long time but only the last couple of months have I considered it a real option, and it seems soothing to me. I was 14 when my dad attempted suicide, and I became numb after that. I don't want to die really, but everything is so damn hard all the time and I have never experienced a time in a life where I thought things were good. I am under stress constantly and feel very alone, without any family or friends to support me. If anyone that sees this could just read my story, I feel really alone and like no one cares about me.I've had depression for as long as I can remember. But later in college it got particularly bad. I was drinking and doing drugs a lot. Shortly after I graduated college, I cheated on my long-term boyfriend/roommate when I got drunk and was out of town. After that happened, even though he forgave me eventually it was really awkward to stay in our house together. I decided to move back to my parents house and get my old high school job back. The first night I stayed at my parents house, we got in a fight and my dad ended up shoving me around. I said I was gonna kill myself while he held me down on the bed (not really meaning it) and he called the cops on me, who took me to the ER. My parents never came to pick me up, and after three days the doctor sent me to a mental hospital in the middle of the night that was 3 hours away. I was there for 8 days before they let me out, but it was pretty traumatizing. My boyfriend picked me up from the hospital and took me back to the house we lived together. Around this same time, I started losing all of my hair. I had very long thick hair and it just all started falling out. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a chronic condition where a woman has higher levels of testosterone than she should. I also started growing facial hair and thick hair all over my body. After the diagnosis I felt worthless and self-conscious and as I watched my hair fall out every day due to male pattern baldness I wanted to die more and more.Shortly after I got out of the mental hospital I received a full-time position in another city so I moved out. Unfortunately since I didn't negotiate a higher pay my job doesn't really pay me a living wage to live in the town I do, it's very expensive here. I didn't know anyone to move with so I signed for an apartment by myself. The cheapest apartment here (which I live in) is still 50% of my paycheck not counting utilities, internet etc. I have spent all of my savings just to survive here, and I feel really stupid for it. Shortly after I moved I met a friend online who I became really close to because we shared a similar dark sense of humor and we really cared about each other. He lived 1000 miles away but we texted all day and Snapchatted. We were really good friends for about 5 months, until Valentines day. We wished each other a happy valentines day and then I didn't hear from him after 2am. I texted him for about a week and I got worried that something was wrong, he didn't want to be friends anymore, etc. I checked his sisters facebook, and it turns out that night he bought what he thought was a morphine pill but it was actually carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer. He died that night, alone in his parents house, on valentines day. It crushed me at a time I was really going through a lot. He was one of my only friends for a while, and it hit me really hard that I could never talk to him again. The months that followed after that were a blur of hating my life at work, being broke, getting drunk and high, and being promiscuous. Dealing with a roach infestation at my apartment. Crying over my hair loss after showers. Shaving everywhere, constantly. Spending my remaining part of my paycheck on doctor's visits, supplements, and \"cure-alls\". After reconnecting with my boyfriend ( who lives 2 hours away) for a few months, I found out I was pregnant after I didn't get my period. As I write this, I am 7 weeks pregnant. At my boyfriend's father's birthday party, his sister revealed she was pregnant (she has a husband/career/nice house). I didn't tell them I was also pregnant because I will probably be getting an abortion. I don't want to, truly. i have always wanted to be a mom, to feel needed and loved by someone else. Unfortunately because I have no money, and my job sucks, and my mental health/ life sucks, I can't give that baby the life it deserves. I figured I'd probably have a miscarriage anyhow, considering what a piece of sh*t my body has been to me. I am not looking forward to the abortion or how I will feel afterward. I am not looking forward to my boyfriend's sister's baby being born, knowing that I had to give mine up.Just last week I got written up at work because I went and picked up my coworker a salad for him, and I used his meal tag to pay for his meal, which I didn't know wasn't allowed. They told me because I was written up I wasn't eligible for a raise next year or a bonus, which I didn't even know existed but desperately needed. They told me if I \"did it again\" I'd be fired. One of my coworkers is constantly mean to me when my boss isn't around, and I often find myself in the bathroom crying because of it. Unfortunately the job is my source of health insurance and food (meal tag) and I don't have any without it. I live in a fancy college town where most people are below my age and have no interest in others except other 19 year olds they met in class. No one here seems poor, they all have nice clothes and everyone seems to be eating out a lot. The girls are young and beautiful and of course hairless. I know this is the case most places, but I feel completely invisible when I am walking around here. The only people that ever talk to me are homeless people. Sometimes I do talk to them because I feel very alone, and beneath everyone here. I can't afford nice clothes, my hair is thinning at an alarming rate, I have hair growing everwhere else even my butt. It makes me feel so ugly. And now I am carrying a baby that only I want, but I can't have. I feel so incredibly stupid. I don't have any friends here to talk to at all, I spend every night and weekend alone. I go out sometimes but I have a bit of social anxiety when it comes to starting conversations with others. Guys will try to flirt with me but that's not what I want.I am currently studying for the GRE to apply to graduate school. But I'm not even sure I want to do that, especially because it's in this city. And I feel that in another two years I'd just be left in the same position I am now; I think the only reason I want to go to school is to escape my job/any full-time job. That sounds stupid. But working only to barely pay my rent has me really burnt out and makes me wish I was a student again. But that's not a good reason to go. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has been a nightmare to me, and I feel a strange psychological disposition toward being a woman. I feel like I exist biologically between a man and woman, like I can't understand being either. I can't imagine having a womanly figure or hairless arms. It makes me resent a lot of attractive feminine women even though I know it's not their fault. I just wish I could be more like them, and I feel really gross the way I am. I feel really weird and self-conscious and don't want other people to see how hairy I am. I can't even afford hair removal things so I've just been covering myself up. It makes me incredibly sad. I'm sorry I made such a long post and I don't think anyone will read it...I guess I just needed to say it all. I don't have any friends or family to talk to, and my boyfriend is on vacation. He's heard me say I want to/going to kill myself too many times now, seems like almost daily for the past two months, so I'm not going to bother him with that anymore. He deserves a lovely girlfriend who is happy with life and doesn't have a lot of problems like me. And i feel bad I haven't been able to be that person. Sometimes it feels like I'm not meant to be alive, it seems like nothing good ever happens to me, and I try very hard to do good things for myself. I really try to be nice to others and make them laugh, but for some reason life has been treating me really crappy with no end in sight. My 20's have been a blur of depression and hardship, and I have nothing to show for it now. I don't know, I just want to die. I am tired and sad. So very sad.",

An hour later, I woke up because there's a knock on my door and I got slapped; he stared for awhile and leave without saying anything with a serious face. I just woke up so the event sink in slowly, when I realized what happened I ran as fast as I can. When I saw him he's about to ride the bus. I walk closer to him, he gave me a questioning look, and i kissed him on the cheek. He got surprised. Then I told him, \"you slap like a girl, dude\". He pouts and chased me as i ran laughing. We got tired and stopped running, then he give me a hug. We said goodbye to each other and he told me, \" Don't let this be the last goodbye, idiot.\"P.s. It's really funny cause he's a guy and he slapped me real hard, my left cheek really hurts until now. Hahahahaha! He didn't even say sorry, that scumbag! 😂😂😂 The chat i sent him was about me saying goodbye cause i can't take it anymore, although i only said it(for now) to see what would be his reaction if I do the deed, I didn't expect him to come in my house(just to slap me lmao) because he's staying in his aunt's which is 45mins away( without traffic). We've never seen each other for a month, too so it is a real surprise. 😂To my friend: Thank you. :) One of the reason I got depressed was I lost contact to you and I can't tell anyone else of my problems. But i guess, you really just gave me a good \"awakening\" today, i hate you for reaching me out with a slap. 😂 I can't tell you now that I'm really depressed because i knew you'll be worried, so i only send you a message saying \"i hate you. Let's meet again when you're free.\", to ensure you I'm still not going...When i've moved on, I'm going to let you see this, idiot.",

      "text": "Tips on how to identify bad writing One thing I have always struggled with was understanding what people mean when they say something is badly written. Sure, I can grasp on some of the basic aspects that cause a particular literary work to be considered poorly written: bland characters with conflicting motivations, dialogue that feels unnatural, plot holes, abundance of overused tropes, etc. However, I do have a hard time identifying these tropes, especially bad dialogue. Maybe it is because I am an introvert weirdo who has about as much social interaction as a crippled ww1 veteran with the spanish flu, but I can only distinguish writing when it is particulary awful (the \"how is your sex life?\" line from The Room) or when it stands out as something wonderful (the \"war backwards\" passage from Slaughterhouse). I would like to know if there was a way to sharpen my perseption of writing. Otherwise, I am afraid I will become a tone-deaf idiot who thinks Dan Brown novels and crappy fantasies for lonely people like Twilight are the pinnacle of storytelling.",

I just recently got a promotion to be the lead of my department (retail). I am a 29 year old single gay male who probably is a bit too promiscuous. I have a roommate who cares about me and we get along great.But even given all that there are days like today where I'm tired. I don't want to go to work or talk to anyone. I don't want someone to make me feel better because I don't feel sad. I don't feel anything. I'm tired and I want it to be over. I'm tired of being the one who has to tell people that there are reasons to care that you are still alive (talked 3 of my friends down from suicide in the last couple months). I don't want to have to deal with being alive anymore. I find myself trying to figure out a way to kill myself and it freaks me out that I have come this far but then 5 minutes later I am back to planning my own death. While writing this I have gone back and forth between planning this as my note to my friends and family and being freaked out that there is nothing wrong so why do I want to kill myself. I can't decide if I'm going to try to kill myself or go to sleep. I hope I can fall asleep before I try something.",

The Land Chaos Seeds series I’m sure everyone has their favorite genre of book for their specific reasons, even if they don’t mind stepping out of that comfort zone for a good book. I have always enjoyed fantasy and have come across a type of fantasy book called LitRPG. Fantasy based with a bit of gaming flare. OMG! I am addicted. It has just enough video game in it to make it different from your ordinary fantasy. (If fantasy can ever be called ordinary lol) The books I have been reading are by author Aleron Kong. The first book of the series is called “The Land: Founding” I recommend this series for anyone who is a fan of fantasy. The authors site provides free chapters to see if you like it prior to purchasing. To me, that is an author who is confident in their ability to grab a reader and bring them into the story. Hopefully this will help someone find a good series that I stumbled upon with the help of my son. Thanks and good reading.",

Silly prose; painfully contrived dialogue; general triteness; gaping plot holes; you name it. Maybe even a no-fault sea change in your subjective preferences. Anything goes. I ask because I just reread Roger Zelazny's \"Jack of Shadows.\" I last read it when I was about eleven, and I remember it as being so heartwrenchingly lyrical and dark and edgy and profound...but Jessica H. Chrysler, IT. IS. AWFUL. It's...it's not even comically awful, it's grievously awful. (If you've read it, BTW, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Let me know and I'll start a thingie about it.) Bottom line: have you ever found yourself disappointed, mortified, or appalled by any of the books you loved when you were young? Why? Edit: Another example--and you'd be totally justified in calling me a fragile-ass snowflake for this one--is Maurice Sendak's \"Outside Over There.\" When I was really tiny, that book was just THE BEST...and as an adult, I find it inexplicably frightening and disturbing beyond all reason. (Actually, this is more \"cower\" than \"cringe\"...it's an objectively great book. But on that note, please consider your weird reactions to be fair game, too.)",

      "text": "Hi, I guess... I don't know how to do this. I posted in depression but maybe I should've posted here...?I've been depressed for nearly 6 years now, and you know it has been worse (suicidal) and slightly better. There was a time for a couple months I thought that maybe life was worth living but it came crashing down again. And I can't realy blame myself, I wasn't worth enough to have such feelings. I don't think I ever was.So I guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lots of problems still lingering from it. And one of my firends when we were out at a pub, he's been my friend for like 12 years now, he said about my father \"I can understand why he remaried with someone with children, cause he knew he'd fucked up with you and wanted to try/start over again\". And I guess that is true cause all he did was to put my sister and I infront of the TV or computer. Though my mother wasn't that good either she put me infront of a book (good, made me scary litterate as a kid) but she always had a bad temper. Like a hellish scream I never heard before. And she's very controlling. So that wasn't that great either. Both had to work alot to get things going for them so I guess I didn't really spend that much quality time with my family. So I waited for my time to leave and then moved out, and today I try to never visit home because I always feel bad when I'm there.And I have been kinda suicidal lately. I remember someone asked me if I was ok and only slept bad. I kinda then proceeded to do as I always do and push those asking away. I don't want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how I feel but I think it's not right. I think I will try and talk with her about something but I don't know how to ask...How should I bring it up that I want to talk about something? Should I do that? Won't they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing? Worse than to be surprised than me taking my life, and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything. Is it right to burden others with the weight of your thoughts? Especially since you meet them and word could spread?I wish I could cry in front of someone and be hugged. I wish I could talk to my friend and tell her how I feel and that I need someone to talk to, but I'm not quite sure she could take it or help me. Is it ok to talk to someone? Is it ok to share what I feel like, looking for some sort of comfort? Can I find comfort in this by talking or will I just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again, can I risk talking to anyone about this? Is it right of me to press something on someone, is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what I am feeling and my suicidal thoughts?",

      "text": "I'm 20 years old, and a couple courses away from a community college diploma in accounting (which can be transferred to give me half of the credits for a bachelor's).I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was about 13, but I never went on medication.I have had good times and bad times over the past few years. It seems that recently the bad times have been getting more frequent.Some courses in school give me no problem at all (I aced things like financial accounting), but if I have to write anything, I will probably fail.From the time I was 9 I remember struggling to write stories in class. Now days, tell me to write a memo, essay, or even something short, and I just can't do it. I have tried dictating it, but that doesn't help. I feel I just don't have the ideas in my head to put on paper. Even when I had to write physics lab reports, I found it impossible.Due to this, I don't think I will ever be able to finish university, and I can't handle working somewhere like a grocery store for my whole life. I'm from Canada, but this year I'm spending a year abroad in Belgium as an au pair. I met my girlfriend in a community jazz band while she was taking a gap year in Canada, and I followed her back to Belgium about a month ago. She is so amazing, and probably the one thing keeping me from falling into a deep depression, and seriously considering suicide right now.I have one day a week totally free, and I basically slept the whole day. I should be exploring Belgium 0, or at least go for a walk down the street. I talked to my girlfriend and she has been supportive, and is trying to help me get out of the house, but I find it impossible. Some days are okay. Yesterday I went to audition for a choir, and it went fairly well. She is a very motivated person, and I'm scared that me doing nothing could pull us apart.I also start things with a great deal of motivation, but it typically fades quickly and I want to quit. This happens with things like school, sports, work, and any other type of activity really. It happens even if it is something I really like. I just find it hard to drag myself to it.I need to figure out how to finish school, I need to figure out how to stay motivated, be able to tolerate my job, and stop being such a negative person all the time.Right now I'm really freaked out because I don't know how I can get through all of this. I don't know what I will do with my life. I have this year to figure things out, then I have to go back to Canada (we did a few months already, but a long distance relationship will be its own challenge) and face reality. I can stay with my mom as long as I am going to school. I am thinking maybe I should push through the 3 courses, and get my diploma as a checkpoint ( I was just going to go to university and go straight for my bachelor's, as I still get the transfer credits). But, I don't have a clue what I should do after that. I think I should probably talk to a professional again. I most likely shouldn't wait until I'm back in Canada, but doing it here in Belgium is intimidating.Thanks",

That's never going to change. The only thing I had going for me was that I started college this year. It's already extremely stressful, but its the only thing that gets me out of the house and I can look forward to actually having something that'll help me get a job later on. The only reason I can go to college is because financial aid covered it entirely. I was originally going to get have tuition covered plus a check for $2K for supplies. Funding was cut down to a check of $100 for supplies.Funding was just cut again. I owe the school $1500 more per semester than aid is covering. I have $250 saved in my bank account, it's all the money I have left from working. All my non-essential assets, if sold, maybe would cover $1000 and would leave me with pretty much nothing but a really cheap laptop. I still wouldn't be able to afford the first semester, let alone next semester and then the three years or so after. My family is dirt poor (which is why I got fin aid in the first place) and living paycheck to paycheck, so that's not even an option.I don't know what to do. Without a college education my life literally has no meaning. I'm fucking worthless to society. No skills, no experience, no goals, no friends, no money, nothing.Going to financial aid office in the morning to see if I do anything that can resolve it. I have a tiny shred of hope it was just an error (highly doubt it). If they say there's nothing they can do to help me out, I'm probably just going to kill myself tomorrow.",

I feel utterly shattered all the time, and can barely get out of bed, let alone go outside. I spend almost all of my time either sleeping, watching classic films or on the internet, usually drinking at the same time. My family are tolerating it for now but I suspect that they won't forever, and I already find it draining to interact with them on a daily basis. Naturally, I venomously loathe myself for being so useless and passive about everything, and of course all of the usual suspects, no prospects, no experience, no friends (purely thanks to myself) etc, etc. The only occasional bursts of energy are when I spontaneously break something or hurt myself like a child, just as an outlet. I keep having a recurring dream in which I'm locked in a dark room with only a noose and a chair. I spend a fair amount of my - unlimited - free time researching methods of suicide and am currently deciding between CO and Opiate overdose.The worst part is that i'm painfully aware of how good I have it compared to other people, with parents that would let me just lie about for months whilst barely complaining.

Something has to break and I suspect that will be me.",

Recently I started high school. I had one friend in the class I was in, yet I decided to change the class so I could be with a \"friend\" that I was in class in middle school. Well, I changed the class, and he treats me like dust. Like I don't exist. I can't believe this. I made my situation from bad to terrible. I had one friend to talk to - now I have literally none. All day in school, alone. I don't think I'm able to change the class again, because you need a replacement person to take the place. This really might seem like a minor thing, \"you'll make friends in the new class\", no I won't. It's full of scum and I have 4 years of this, everyday in front of me. I left the school early because I wanted to cry and I wasn't able to sit there any longer. I had a mental breakdown today and stood on the train tracks thinking if I should end it. I decided not. Then I go back to my house, and it appears the teacher called my mom. There, I had an argument with her. I thought that it would get better. But it didn't. It seems like no one cares about what I feel. I'm completely alone now and this really makes me want to put an end to this. In the end, we all will die, so it's basically like a shortcut. I don't know. I really don't. It's such a simple thing to fix - just change my class back to the old one. But these pieces of shit teachers don't give a single fuck about it. Fuck this shit man.",

      "text": "Help with SO who is suicidal Hi guys, I am in a tough place right now. Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their \"antidepressant.\" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: SO: I want to die me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? SO: I'm already hurting myself me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/\"end my suffering\"/\"end me\" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a \"nerd\" or told \"stop worrying about me\" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with \"what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?\" That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. What should I do, you guys? I don’t know what is going on, I don’t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don’t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don’t know if I should stay with them if this continues—not because they have depression, but because they won’t address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. We’ve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I’m not an antidepressant. I’m a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don’t want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.",

      "text": "Hey, my name is Beau and I've never posted on here before but I don't think I can keep all my pain I anymore. I feel like I should start much earlier than 6 years ago so here I go.When i was 3 years old I was diagnosed with a brain tumour. I spent 2 years in and out of hospital, I didn't even know what was happening all I knew was that my parents were letting these scary people in white jackets take me away and put me to sleep. I would scream and scream at my parents while the doctors dragged me away. I think this is where I first felt that I couldn't trust people and that I was completely alone. I got better after that and went to a nice school, it seemed like everything was fine. I made some great friends I still know very well today and I seemed to be adjusting well even though I joined school late. Then I turned 8 and everything fell apart again, I got another brain tumour and this time I was older and wiser and so was more fearful than the time before. I knew what was happening and I didn't want to die. I won't go on about it again but obviously I survived but it left me with some complication. My pituitary gland had been damaged by Chemotherapy and so I couldn't go through pubity unless I had the help of synthesized growth hormones which I had to inject into my stomach every night for about 8 years. They worked pretty well though. I would never have grown an inch and I'd still be the height I was at 10 years old but I'm 5'9 which is fine with me. There was one problem though, I felt that my head was quite a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body because the growth hormones I was given were only experimental. I was bullied a lot at school for looking weird and it hurt my confidence quite a bit but I never spoke to anyone about it. Then I went to college and got to 're invent myself and it was great for about a year that then you realise you can't really change what you look like and even though everyone liked me I still got bullied by a few people but the thing that really bothered me was that none of the girls I liked wanted to go out with me. Well I know that obviously not everyone is going to fall head over heels for you but it actually feels a lot worse than being bullied because the people who are rejected you aren't bad people. They're good people, they don't bully you for how you look but they understand the bullying and thus don't find you attractive for the same reasons the bullies bully you.Now let's get to the title. I've spent the last 6 years living with a girl that I've been In love with for about 5 of those years. We've had an incredibly strange relationship. We were never going out. We never had sex. We never kissed. It's wasn't romantic for her. But we did spend all day sometimes lying in bed hugging and kissing each other anywhere but the lips. I was extremely confused because i told her I liked her but she said she didn't want to ruin our friendship. We've spent almodt every day together for the last 6 years. Im not a person anymore, I've lost my identity. Fast forward to now. She's decided she doesnt want to live with me anymore so she can go out with another guy. One that she wants to be with, he's taller , stronger and hotter than me. You can read the jealousy in my writing but she is my world and we've been together for so long that to me she was my other half. Now I'm alone. I'm having to move back to my parent and I actually just want to kill myself. The saddest thing is she doesn't even seem to miss me which lowers my self esteem two fold. I think the main reason I'm sad and she isn't is that I know that the time I spent with her even though she didn't love and never wanted to be intimate with me was still the best I could ever expect for myself. I'll be alone now for the rest of my life but she is beautiful and so will be fine. She find the things I gave her and more from her new boyfriend. I don't know what to do, should I just kill myself if the best time of my life is over now? I need some advice from people who won't sugar coat it.",

      "text": "I've always been very personal and private about my depression and anxiety, I always wanted to keep it all to myself and maybe I could help someone by sharing my story, but the time for that has never come. I'm not embarrassed of what I've done, rather scared that no one would be able to look at me the same if they knew. The first time I really tried to kill myself I took a handful of oxy and went for a drive, expecting not to be able to react (it was between 1-3am on a weekday in 2014) I drove my favorite canyon road, by the time I got to the end of the road, everything went black, and I woke up a few hours later, pulled over safely. I'm not sure why I pulled over, or why I didn't just let myself crash, but I didn't. The next year I spent most every day on some kind of hard drug, intermittently trying to OD, but it never worked. Then January 5th of 2015 after a terrible acid trip, and even more terrible interaction with people I thought cared about me, I tried to end my life. I wrote 6 letters, to my sister, my mom, my dad, and my 3 closest friends, I snorted half a gram of ketamine, drank 1/3 of a bottle of fireball, and took all the Valium that was prescribed to me that month (about 60 pills) and slit both my wrists. I was living at home with my parents after dropping out of college, my dad travels 3 or more weeks out of every month, and my mom was staying with my grandmother who was dying and if my dad had time off he'd stay with them in California and leave me with the house to myself. My parents never knew of my addiction or how bad I had gotten. Back to January 5th, my parents were home but used to me not leaving my room for days at a time, and my mom busts into my room at around 3pm on the 7th and pulls open my blinds and yells that it's time for me to do something, anything, and storms out of my room slamming my door. And as unlikely as it may seem I came to. My sheets were bloody, the letters still sat on my night table next to my bed, and my mom didn't even look at me or the slew of drugs and alcohol on my night table. The only thing I remember from my attempted suicide was becoming very cold and seeing nothing but black, until I saw just my own face emerging from the blackness, I didn't interact with myself, I didn't say anything, or rather don't remember saying anything, and the peaceful darkness of me staring at my own face in darkness was interrupted by my moms voice of her barging in my room. For the next 4 months I went back to school, and wore long sleeve shirts, well into spring break, when I finally slipped, my family and I went out for family dinner and I wore a long sleeve sweater, and as I reached across the table to grab something, my mom saw my scarred wrist. I had been waiting for them to heal enough so that I could get a tattoo to cover them up, but they were badly scarred and unsightly. I never told anyone what happened that night, other than telling my mom I tried to kill my self months earlier. I have never been afraid of death, nor the repercussions of killing myself until my family sat me down and each of them told me how it would have affected them, and how it would affect everyone that knew me. This didn't scare me, but made me feel terrible, made me feel even more like a burden, and I knew I'd never be able to escape their fears of me attempting again. For the next year I got daily check ins from my family, which inevitably slowed as the year progressed, and finally the anniversary was upon me again, and overwhelmed with emotion, I attempted again, however this time I just tried to OD on sleeping meds and barbiturates. I had been living with my best friends and their girlfriends in a house near my school, and when I attempted I believe this was the closest I got to death, I started having extreme trouble breathing, my heart was racing, my vision was blurry, and I was terrified. I made a last ditch effort to throw up some pills, after I made myself throw up I passed out in my shower in my room. Again, never told anyone, and no one was the wiser that this had just occurred. I'm not sure how I could help anyone with this story, but I always hoped that maybe I could help someone feeling like they can't go on, like they are afraid every day that they could take their own life, but the truth is I still feel that way. After all the therapy I've gone through, after all the experiences that have gotten me here, I still have a daily thought about how I'd do it again, about how I won't fail next time. All the while trying to be there for my friends in their times of weakness, and there for my family to try and be the goofy light hearted son/brother they'd known. It's just not me anymore, and it's lonely knowing I have to keep these things to myself, so I don't scare or put stress on those around me, on those who still care about me.",

I thought it was over. But fortunately, he fell into the 2nd floor roof and only suffered a few bruises. He's ok now, as good as possible, but I find myself in a complicated situation, I am clinically depressed and bipolar, and we both had attempted to suicide before. He's unemployed since february, and very unhappy in college. At this point, I don't now what to say to him, we live alone here in Brasil, and there is no hope for us here. We're trying to move to Europe, but everything's so hard for him. Since his father died he has no strength to move on. And even doing everything that I can, I am unable to keep him up for long.

But despite me saying bo lectures I got a total of two solid awnsers telling me carbon monoxide poisoning. Newer cars are built to not give off as much Carbon to kill someone, so where does a 16 year old get carbon monoxide, simple, he doesnt. Please I am desperate and lokking for awnsers. My name is Jordan I am 16 years of age and I have pretty much ruined any chance I have at being happy. I have built this reputation of just being sad and lonely, so making any move in order to turn my ways around just seems off and never works. I have no friends, the people I do see normally just make fun of me. Never had a girlfriend or people I can trust. My dad was born with 2 kidneys that didn't function correctly. So his entire life has has gone through 3 different kidney transplants. So I know he wont be around much longer, my great grandpa just passed away and he meant the world to me. The sadness is just overwhelming and I am desperate for awnsers.Please bare in mind I am 16 years old and I live in Canada, so it's not like I can just really quickly pick up a gun and off myself. Things like sleeping pills are hard to get ahold of.By best im hoping to find the least painful way with the higest sucess rate. If it is hard to get ahold of but does the job than please still recommend it, with just ideas to get ahold of it. I thank you for listening. :)",

I spent a lot of time in both hospital and then mental health clinics pretty much all my teenage life with small stages in between going to school and being a somewhat normal kid .My family were really supportive and being the youngest of 3 siblings I had a lot of love. However I've never been able to shake the feeling that I ruined their lives too when this whole thing happened. I've been living with this guilt that I turned my family's lives upside down forever. This didn't help when I turned to suicide as my only option at the age of 14. Between 14 and 21 I overdosed 6 times all failing evidently. I'm 25 now and objectively have a a good life. I'm Melbournian ( allegedly the most liveable city 7 years in a row - sorry for humble brag haha) I have a masters degree, I'm apparently attractive even though I feel l like a hideous monster. Middle class in a developed country. But I don't care about any of this stuff. I just want to die. Everyday I feel like the same 12 year old girl screaming and crying and feeling it's never going to end and I'm so much pain. It's like I can time travel and be in the exact moment, and I just can't bare the pain. What's more is that dating is absolute hell. Ive dated a bit. serious and non serious but anything that gets slightly serious they abandon me when the find out what happened. And don't get me wrong I get it's a big thing to deal with but these are guys that are like telling my they love me and stuff. I dunno I guess I shouldn't tell anyone. It's just hard when it's a part of your identity- I never got to be an adult or even an adolescent without this. I love my family too much to ruin their lives even more..but I feel I'm condemned to life as opposed to death. I really wish the man who did this to me just killed me when he had the chance.",

They were all very sick but we nursed them back to health and found homes for 3 of them.We kept 2 of them and they became inseparable along with my girlfriend's cat. Dexter was bigger than the other cats since little and therefore no one wanted him. But he grew up to be the sweetest cat I've ever had.He was 15 lbs and never ever scratched us. He would always sleep next to my girlfriend and was just an overall sweet gentle big cat.The thing is, he would sometimes breathe weirdly and we didn't pay much attention to it. 4 days ago he became very ill and we took him to the vet right away. Apparently there was some sort of weird bacteria growing close to his lungs and heart.Now I don't think this is what killed him, both my girlfriend and I think he was too stressed and the vet didn't wait long enough for him to calm down before putting a syringe in him to take the liquid out. In the end he died right on my hands even though they had told us less than 5 mins prior that he would be okay to be taken to a 24 Hour emergency vet. He died of stress in my hands and I can't get the image out.I can't help but feel like I failed an innocent creature whose life depended on me.

My mother was already in rehab from an incident two years prior and my father had just lost his job because of his alcoholism. I ended up crashing at my brother’s where I started applying for jobs nd going to interviews, which I never got because of my lack of reliable transportation. I scraped by with my grades, I graduated, and started my part time retail job the very next day. Fast forward to today, almost a year and a half later. I’m still working that part time job while working a full time factory job all summer long that I quit because they kept scamming me out of money. I’m 19 and bi, I’ve never been in a relationship, the homelessness situation fucked up my grades as stated, all of my friends were toxic and just plain neglected me and I had to hide my sexuality from them or face complete social suicide, and I’m still crashing at my brother’s. The only thing different is my dad helped me get my bucket on the road. Almost every day I wake up in a “I want to die” mood. Every day I’m subjected to seeing the people that cheated off of my tests, and took credit for my accomplishments, or just used up my support and just ended up throwing me in the trash after their come up starting their second year of university, or going on some sort of getaway, or just spending time with their family while I can’t even start classes at my local community college. Through no fault of my own and after all the hard work I live the life of a burnout yet I don’t smoke weed (often) or drink (at all) because I care about my wellbeing and my ability to find a job. I’m not an idiot, I’m not ugly, I’m not an inconsiderate asshole, I don’t hate myself, all the people I went to school with think I’m some kind of weirdo, and nobody ever treats me with respect. Everyone says “it gets better” but I feel like I’m going to be stuck at the bottom forever. My set of skills really aren’t going to land me a job where there will be people my age, and unless there’s a well paying job I can’t work only 40 hours a week and afford rent and groceries. I feel like no one will understand what I’ve been through and just completely disregard me entirely. I’ve already started seeking help (I’ve got an appointment next Thursday but I feel like I need something to help me out until then). I’m just so afraid of having to work my life away for nothing it’s what makes me want to die so much. I just feel so alone like no one else in the world will be able to relate and I’ll just be alone for my entire life no matter how hard I work.",

I was living \"normally\" until in 2015 I began questioning my faith, Islam. It was recently 9 months ago where I had the courage to completely renounce it.Now, I feel depressed and oppressed. Because I look different, I've always been bullied by the local kids for my looks from elementary to highschool, both verbally and physically. I'm also Bisexual, which makes it all the worse. So I'm living as an in-closet atheist and bi. Why not come out?Because I'd be given the death sentence if they found out, that if my own family didn't kill me first.Even with all that, I had managed to always ace my exams and top my classes. I even got enrolled into Medicine and got a perfect GPA(5/5) in my first year at the university. But then, slowly, I fell into depression and my grades suffered a lot. My GPA went all the way down to 3.1/5 and I even failed a whole year. You can imagine what an Asian parent would do if their child failed at college.I'm positive that both my parents are narcissists. My mom keeps telling me that she \"owns\" me because she gave birth to me. My dad took away all my savings(over 2k$) because in Islam it's permissible to do that. There's an Islamic script(Hadith) allowing it: ���You and your wealth belong to your father�۝, narrated by Abu Dawood (3530) and Ahmad (6640) . But I secretly opened a bank account and started over from the beginning. Although I don't have much in it right now..And my mom has been forcing me to go to the mosque 5 times a day, everyday. I've been putting up with it for so long and i can't take it any longer. She even forbid me from listening to music..My chest is heavy all the time except while spending time with my friends. I have a few good IRL's and a bunch of internet friends that keep me in check. I really wish if I could run away.. My original plan was to finish medicine, and use my degree to work somewhere else. But that'd take up to 6 years.. And I don't think I can pass it in my current mental state anyways.Please, if you know a way for me to move out and run away tell me about it. I really need it.

      "text": "Just too much. Lately I feel things have been too much. It feels like I just hit the maximum I can take. I am going to start from the beginning.I grew up in a shitty city with out my real dad, who I never met. He was arrested and charged with hainus crime before I was born. I lived with my mom and my stepdad my whole life. We never had any money and I was homeschooled so I never had a true friend until I was 8. The only \"friend\" I had growing up at the time constantly molested me. She was a family friend so she was trusted with me a lot. I honestly can't forgive her and it hurts a little when I see her happy guilt free with a family and kid. I know that makes me a horrible person but it feels she took something from me. Because of that dark time for me I can never see myself in a real relationship.My stepdad lucky for me never physically or sexually abuse me, but he seemed to always love humiliating me. And I don't mean like being a human around my friends. The one time I never forget is when I was with my family at this weekend party. Just a bunch of people riding horses and having a good time. I was about 9-10 at the time so I still didn't think things through properly. There was a balcony with a buffet and directly in front of it were picnic tables were people ate. After getting a full plate, I decided to just set on the balcony and enjoy my meal there. My fatal mistake was placing the plate of food on the deck so I can sit down. I am going to guess this dog has been waiting for this moment his whole life because he was instantly enjoying my food. So I decided to just throw my food away, because I didn't want dog saliva and what ever dog ass he licked that day. My dad was not having any of that, he had a couple beers at this point so he was buzzed. So in front of friends and family he started screaming at me for letting the dog eat my food and he decided instead of waisting all of that precious food I should eat it. There is nothing like being screamed at will eating dog food in front of people you know.My only friend at the time treated me like shit. And just like the last one he sexually abused me. He was not as bad as the last but I still fucking hated it. He at the time was in the closet and I am going to guess he was struggling with his sexuality. I have nothing against him for not being straight, but there were lines he crossed. He was 5 years older than me so he was more sexually mature than I was.I can keep listen things that keep me up all night but I doubt any one cares. So I am going to cut to the chase. I am 17 going on 18, failing school, have no job, and no friends. The only family member who haven't said they hated me is my mom. I always feel unwelcome and a lot of it is my fault because I don't trust anyone. So I made a deal with myself, I am going to join the Army. If I don't get accepted or I can't make the cut I am going to end it. I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here, I'll delete it if I need to.",

      "text": "I really like the way Ann Leckie handles aliens So I'm nearly done with , Ann Leckie's new book, and what's really striking me is the unique way she approaches aliens and humans and how they interact. This is explored somewhat in the Ancillary trilogy with the Presgar and their \"translators\" but delves into it even more with the Geck. I feel like so many sci-fi authors either write their aliens as completely inscrutable beings we'll never be able to communicate with or as basically humans - maybe they have different bodies and different cultures, but they assimilate with us fairly easily in spite of this (the Star Trek approach.) In the Imperial Radch universe, interacting with aliens is a dangerous and unpredictable business. There is a treaty that governs how members of different species interact with one another, and since one of the alien races that signed the treaty doesn't distinguish between different human governments if any human breaks the treaty all humans will have been considered to have broken the treaty. There is very little common ground between the different races and very little in the way of cultural exchange. We are just fundamentally too different to really get along. But, at the same time, they have become a part of every day life that people accept. There's some excitement if an alien ship docks in your little port, but no more so than if the mayor were to walk into the restaurant where you work. It's a story you'll tell that night at dinner, but it's not life-altering. If you're a bureaucrat or a government employee, an alien getting involved with things mostly just means a lot of annoying paperwork.It seems to me that if we ever were to meet aliens, they would fall somewhere between these two extremes, that we'd find a way to coexist but never really assimilate. I can't think of any other works that manage to thread that needle in a way that feels believable, and honestly I'm just really impressed by it.Do other people who have read the books agree? What other works handle aliens in a similar way?",

      "text": "Why did Martin Luther write his treatise \"The Jews and their Lies\"? Why did he hate Jews so much? I recently addressed this in:~~Martin Luther the writer was popular. popular. From 1520-26 alone, Hans-Joachim Köhler has estimated that \"\" there were copies of pamphlets and longer texts by Luther avalanching off German printing presses. Luther's words, in short, were everywhere.And these words included, in 1523, the pamphlet , in which Luther asserts that Jews are the true relatives of Christ: \"they are blood friends, fathers, and brothers of our Lord.\" Christians, meanwhile, can only be \"foreigners\" and \"brothers-in-law.\" In the context of late medieval hatred of Jews, contemporaries perceived this as a bold and courageous statement. The late Middle Ages into the early modern era, recent scholarship has demonstrated, witnessed the creation of anti- out of anti---that is, a change from hatred rooted in Jewish religion to a racialized, biological hatred of Jews as a people. Notably, Christians were believing more and more that even Jews' conversion to Christianity could not truly \"take\"--if they weren't already doing so just for show, they would inevitably slide back into Judaism; they couldn't help it. In this passage, on the other hand, Luther follows up a strident belief and desire for the conversion of individual Jews to Christianity with the thundering statement that Jews are blood brothers and Gentiles are foreigners to Christ himself.But already in Luther's lifetime, people were making a critical interpretative mistake when reading his texts that continues to dog the man today: they failed to consider his remarks in the immediate context and purpose of the particular text he was writing. I don't want to say \"more so than others,\" because to a historian everyone's words only make sense in context, but the issue is particularly pertinent for Luther because of how public and highly charged his writing was already treated as in his own time. You can find in Luther's writing from around 1530 beautiful words of support for women as part of the priesthood of all believers and \"your sons will prophesy\" from the prophet Joel; you will also find him railing against women daring to speak in public, not least about religion. The difference is that in the first, Luther is attacking the Catholic concept of a sacral priesthood; the second, evangelical women and their husbands need to learn proper Christian behavior.And so in , it's absolutely vital to understand this is (1) Luther defending himself against accusations from his opponents that he has denied Mary's virginity even to the point of saying Joseph was Jesus' biological father (2) Luther . No, really. To Luther, in this treatise, the newfound freedom of the Gospel from the clutches of Roman idolatry is also a brilliant new beginning for : they can convert truly to Christianity, real Christianity, now. Their earlier failure to convert was because of the heretical trappings built up by the medieval Church.Unfortunately, Luther's contemporaries--Christians and Jews alike--got stuck on the notes expressed here (Jews are Christ's blood-brothers; Christians should \"deal with Jews in a friendly way\") and missed that the whole point was So in 1536, when then-Duke of [Electoral] Saxony Johann Friedrich declared a sweeping expulsion of all Jews from his territory (standard practice cascading across Europe), Jews and their Christian practical-allies saw Luther as a powerful ally. Wolfgang Capito, the key Straßburg reformer, put well-known and brilliant Jewish leader Josel von Rosheim in touch with Luther to ask for intercession with the prince. The hope and expectation on both men's parts, and obviously the community the one represented, was absolutely that Luther would want to help.But Luther said no.Capito's angle in levying the request, as a scholar of the Hebrew language (for Christian purposes, of course), was the contributions of Jews to local intellectual life and scholarship. In this time period, Christian willingness to not kick Jews out always, always, always depends on how Christians benefit. What Capito failed to recognize was that for Luther, the scales of \"Christian benefit\" had tipped into the negative from his famous 1523 polemic.Luther's earlier \"friendliness,\" remember, hinged on his belief that with the shackles of popery cast off Christianity, Jews would turn towards the light of the Gospel. Throughout his life, he continued to full-heartedly accept Jewish converts to Christianity when he was convinced they were sincere about it. But what Luther's theological-biographer Heiko Oberman has called the apocalyptic \"Darkness at Noon\" had set in by the 1530s with the maturation of evangelical reform--in particular, realization of its limits. The early exultation of the success of over the land ossified into either recognition or reconstruction of pockets of Catholic resistance, lack of Christians' knowledge of basic tenets of the faith, perceived failures of local preaching and education. The entire Reformation proceeded under the purview of imminent Armageddon. For Luther, the threat only grew stronger over the course of his life and the unarguable--to everyone else-- of the movement he launched.This affected his recommendations on how to deal with Jews for two reasons. First, the hope that Jews would convert to Christianity simply because of evangelical reform had dimmed and died. Completely. Second, the late medieval mythology of Jews as the \"forerunners of Antichrist\" occupied a more prominent place in Luther's apocalypticism, as did the Turks creeping closer to Vienna. One pattern that scholars have pointed out is that Luther's apocalyptic polemic shifted its focus from the pope/Rome to peasants to Jews over the course of his life. That is, the intensity of his opprobrium darkened and lightened, while never vanishing. For Luther passing through the 1530s into the 40s, yes, his rhetoric against Jews reaches feverishness.To be clear, though, we are talking about Luther's views on how to treat Jews in the immediate present. By 1536, and spiraling further from there, Luther saw Jews as largely a mission ground. They had not converted; current Jews threatened Christians' own belief. As Oberman argues, Luther's actual views of Jews--his understanding of Jews and Judaism in light of Christian theology and 16th century society--had not changed. But with developing societal circumstances, his views of sure had. And devastatingly:Firstly, that their synagogues or schools should be burned down, and what will not burn should be razed adn covered with earth, that no man will ever see a stone or cinder of it again...Next, that their houses should be broken and destroyed in the same way...They can be put under a roof or stable, like the gypsies. [ -sun]Third, that all their prayer books and Talmuds, in which such idolatrous lies, curses, and blasphemies are taught, should be taken from them...Fourth, that their rabbis should be forbidden, at risk of life and limb, to teach from now on...Fifth...they have no reason to be in the country.Sixth...all their cash and fortunes in silver and gold should be taken from them and put in safekeeping.Seventh, that young, strong Jewish men and women should be given flail, axe, hoe, spade, distaff, spindle, and be left to earn their bread by their sweat...For as all can see, God's wrath over them is so great that gentle mercy will only make them worse and worse, and harsh treatment little better. So away with them at all costs.Medieval and early modern rhetoric in religion and politics often seems sharp enough to cut skin on its own, it's true. But it's impossible to deny that what Luther prescribes in (1543) \"can be safely termed a pogrom\", as Oberman carefully puts it. (\"Safely termed\"--yeah, he's aware.)What's still evident amidst the abhorrent virulence and violence, which make no mistake would be mobilized in support of violence for centuries to come, is Luther's underlying belief in the hope of Jewish conversion to Christianity--and the crushing of that hope:We must exercise harsh mercy with fear and trembling, in the hope that we could save some from the flames and embers [of hell]. We must not avenge ourselves.This is worn out, worn down, but always firey Luther's apocalypticism taking over. The failure of Jews to convert is to him a sign of the devil's triumph over the earth. Luther impresses Christians to serve as God's agents against the Jews as the devil's, for the protection of Christians and in hopes of saving one, two, any Jews at all through fear and trembling if friendliness would not work. Even the 1544 Wittenberg Hymnal had a hymn reminding Christians that Christ's crucifixion was the result of that Christ wanted to redeem out of love--not the fault of Jews. \"The guilt is ours,\" runs the hymn, about the Passion. Unfortunately, when it came to stoking the metaphorical and literal fires of anti-Semitism, the guilt is also that of Luther and his interpreters.",

My family is crazy with their own shit going on but are generally loving people. Friends are plentiful and kind. I'm educated and easy on the eyes. I turn 32 soon and don't think about suicide as an urge when I'm stressed out or emotional. It's just kind of an accepted end whenever things get to be too much.Been dealing with kind of covert depression for awhile with self harm behavior for as long as I can remember. Suicide always feels like a decent/reasonable option, like leaving a party you didn't really want to be at anyways. It's constantly on my mind as a way out. Just spent an evening by myself today and as I was heading home I casually thought about walking in front of a bus. Why didn't I? I wouldn't want my husband or family to deal with the fallout. \"What would people say?\" Lol.Does anyone else feel like you're mainly wearing a mask for your loved ones so you don't jostle their idea of your perfect life?Just looking for insight, I guess.",

The funny thing is that when I do finally get up the courage to follow through, I'm so scared of death that the best case scenario is for someone to find me and save me so I can buy myself some time where I can just for a little while longer.

      "text": "Brother keeps threatening suicide, refuses professional help. So this whole mess began just 4 days ago when he called the suicide hotline and they had an ambulance bring him to a hospital for an evaluation. They let him out the same day and gave him a note to take the day off from work. The very next day he called my mother saying he was ready to go and he was done with life. He told her he would jump in front of a car. I called him as my mom headed over to see him in person and I kept his attention on the phone until my father made it to his apartment. My parents had a long talk with him and he worked out a plan, including a dr visit and therapy, to start fixing some of the issues that have lead to this and he promised to check in with my mother twice a day to let her know he's doing alright. Everything was looking fine until tonight he snapchatted my brother a picture of 9 xanax and his alcohol and turned his phone off. With no way to get in touch, my brother who lives a bit closer (25 minutes) drove to his apartment and called the police who said to call them back when he gets there if he doesn't answer. Well thankfully he did answer his door but despite everything he tried, my brother refused to give him the pills and told him to leave or he would call the police because he's trespassing. So with his phone off, we have no idea if he's alive at this point or not. He has told us to not call 911 or any emergency services or he would kill himself for sure when he gets back to his place. We are left in a situation where he refuses any help, and has caused the whole family to be worrying 24/7 while there is nothing we are able to do. Is there anything someone out there can think of that we can do? Or do we sit around until he makes good on his threats? Only idea I have after reading a bit online is involuntary commitment but I fear that would make the situation worse if it even worked out. He has no history of suicide or any attempts so they would probably send him on his way.",

Honestly, I'm thankful for all the extra time that I've had. There were lots of good memories that I wouldn't have gotten to have if I had died that night, and great people that I'd have never known.But I still feel the same way I did before, it's been sitting in the back of my mind all this time, sometimes barely noticeable and other times almost consuming my thoughts; but always there. And now I'm finding myself winding down the same fucking path as last time, pushing people away, spending all my time alone, slowly losing all motivation to carry on living an okay life; and there's no reason for it. Nothing set it off. There's been no noticeable change in my life up until I started slipping away, and it's going to ruin me.I've never wanted to kill myself, I'm scared by the idea of it, but I have wanted to die for as long as I can remember, and I know that I can go through with it, with a lot more success than last time.

Barely had any friends because I was introverted/suck at socialising, gets called names often, and even when I try to do good like lending my teacher some tissue and she complimented that my future girlfriend would be blessed. Ended up with a few laughs instead. But it wasn't too bad. I had a fair bit of friends and managed to slug through. The senior years came, when the girls come to our school. Thought it was my chance to start afresh and have a better time. Tried to socialise more, talk to more girls, etc. Mistake came when I liked a girl and sent some cheesy stuff. The girl told everyone I was a creep and the news spread. Lost my new friends and even a lot of my old ones. People I don't know look at me like a criminal. Acquaintances I talked to tell me some people call me a pervert. The class doesn't even see me as part of it (I'm always in that shitty corner of the class with empty seats beside me). It is really hard to pull through now, especially when big exams are coming and you barely have anyone by your side, so much so I don't have to be there for my attendance to be marked. Graduation ceremony just happened and no one wanted a photo with me. I'm trying hard to pull through, but it hurts man I didn't even do anything that bad. I'm trying my best to maintain my grades and it sucks to have no one to study with or to have no one inviting you even to join them at the graduation dinner table... It is like I don't exist, and when they see me I'm like a plague... TLDR: I screwed up and now I get shunned: it hurts me a lot everyday and I'm trying to force myself to smile and go through this.

Here i am at nearly 27 and it has only gotten worse. I can no longer mask it with my shitty humor and drinking. I no longer see a chance for myself to get better. I moved to ******** at one of the darkest points in my life and aparantly have spent the last 4 years supressing and bottling up these feelings because \"its not okay to feel like this in a town like this\". I thought i was getting better, i really did, but i see now that i was just replacing my feelings with alcohol abuse. The situation with my car really screwed me up. Losing the freedom to do anything on my own, losing all sense of independance has eaten away at me for the past few years. It is not a good feeling to be 26 and not be able to drive yourself to the grocery store or go for a long drive at night. I miss being able to just go-i cant do that anymore. I realize now that ive never had a meaningful relationship. Ive been a jealous, paranoid, possessive monster to anyone who's shown any remote interest in me. Its no surprise that no one wants me. I hope some day that the women i treated so badly can forgive me. I feel terrible for being so out of touch with my family but i think it is for the better. It'll cushion the blow i suppose. I just want them to know that i love them and truly appreciate everything theyve done for me my whole life. Im sorry i couldnt be better. I know this is going to be hard for you all but i assure you that life will go on just fine without me. As for my friends, i will miss you and all of the good times we had together, but a lot of you have made it pretty clear that you're better off without me. Thank you to those of you who took the time to listen to me, unlike the many who promised to always be there if i needed to talk, only to screen my calls and refuse to take 5 minutes out of your lives to call and see how i was. I just want my true friends to know that i know who they were, and im sorry that this will hurt you. I know how selfish this is. I know that theres always an option of things getting better, but all i see is the option of things getting worse, and i cant take it anymore. I dont see the light that i used to, no silver lining, no saving grace. All i can see is pain for me and burdon to everyone around me. Tell my dog im so, so sorry, and that i promise things will be better for him, give him a big belly rub for me.

      "text": "Been feeling EMPTY inside for 10+ years and Depressed Well, i want to start out with brief about what all happened to me and i kinda feel like shit ever since 2008. When a triple-tragedy struck me. I have never spoken about any of this to anyone, let alone the internet. this is my deep feelings and thoughts who i wanted to share with someone who can come up with answersbefore 2008, I was a really happy, crazy and adventurous person. And i studied in england from 1999 to 2005. After that period i came back to my home country and met an amazing women in 2006 and we instantly fell over each other. Everything was going great between me, her and everything was exception in my life, like my business, my adventures and excursions and everything i could ever ask for. I smoked, drank, partied and above all, went to long nature trips in mountains and hills. I don't know how it started but my women & me started having a few problems over getting married. She was insisting on quick marriage, and i wanted more time thinking we were still young and everything fell apart and fights happened. Then i found out few weeks later that she was sleeping with someone else and i legit felt suicidal and even tried to twice. ( this was 2007-late) i kept crying man-tears for 6 months, had panic and anxiety attacks at night and i was literally losing 5-10 KG weight between that period.And then in 2008-mid, triple tragedy struck. First my girl, outright confessed to me, that she was with someone else and dumped me, and married someone else abroad and met me one last time before going out to another country saying me final goodbye. a few days later, my dad died under mysterious circumstances, with some saying he committed suicide and some thinking he had brain hemorrhage. A couple of days, after he passed away. the Banks came over to my company, took over all the assets and sold it to another company and gave me literally peanuts. And it was all hell which broke loose during that month. I had been reduced from living like a king to a roadside homeless beggar. almost overnight. Within 6 months, i started my new company from scratch paid off my father's pending loans, creditors and taxmen (which would continue to be paid off even 5 years later). I ultimately got married and have a son now. and after that i came to know that my mother had a secret affair with one of the worst humans i know even during the time when my father was alive. I confronted her and she didnt give me a straight answer. Few months later, she took all the money, property papers etc and fled to this monster of a man. I confronted her again and ultimately she wanted me & my wife/son out of the house. Eventually we had to move out and i was thrown out of her inheritance and strangely my sisters also accepted my mother's decision and stayed with her and sided with her. they took almost 90% of my money (which i foolishy gave them and trusted them)Ever Since then, my life has been close to hell. My wife thinks she had bad luck that she got married to me and face all these problems which other women don't and it had made her infuriated against me even for a small issue, to which i cant say a word anymore. i couldn't and cannot fully concentrate on my work, even though work is going OKish. I am surrounded 24/7 by nostalgia of how my life had been and how it just slipped right out of my hands despite my best fucking efforts. I used to be so driven and willing to take risks. But now im a shadow of my own self, withering in pain silently, not able to say anything back to anyone and just accepting how things are. I work silently and still give in my best thought and best efforts. Literally almost all family connection i had is now a faded memory, the person i loved a most and who loved me the most was my dad. Everyone else is estranged now. Anyone else in my position at any given point between these last 10 years, would outright commit suicide. But i have stood upright and taken in all wrong and right criticism thrown at me and i have literally taken everything on the chin. I think its wrong that i am alive and i feel EMPTY inside. No emotions, just a long dull pain. What i have gone through, i cannot even imagine anyone else being in that position and living through it. I literally was a millionaire and then became peniless , millionaire again and now again just passing through time. Even though i dont have money problems even now. Everything else just feels COLD. Emotionless, like a gulp in the wind. I literally had a heartbreak with my own life, which i loved so much and now whatever i try, i'm just clutching at straws. I even tried smoking weed once or twice a month and i must say, it gives me a clear vision for that month and makes me bit more calm. Every single thing is telling me to end this life and i still foolishly carry on..... I don't know why im built like rock to withstand all the bullshit i have had to face so far. Please tell me what to do.......",

I could throw up because of how worthless I feel, All I want is him. I'm giving him the time and space to decide if he wants to be with me and if his decision is to never come back, then that's the only way this could get worse. My heart is broken all because of me ruining this relationship.",

My dad is a scary man, even my mom is scared of him. My mom is nice and supportive but she changed because of my dad lately. Everyone has. My sister even had a breakdown saying she wanted to kill herself for the longest time. But now back to me. I'm literally crying right now. My dad is idk, a dictator in a way, he has his ways and he will follow them. He is the only way money comes in as my mom is a housewife. But actually back to me. Lately, I been sad like usual. But nowadays for about a month now, it is constant. It hasn't been like the spikes of depression I used to have, and I have been crying a lot. In fact I think I cried more in a span of 2 months than the span of 2 years before that. I'm constantly sad and thinking of dying quietly and just catch a breath. But there is one thing that saves me. It's school and I can keep a smile on in front of everyone. I mean I got friends and I got girls that I would like to impress not drive away. I'm just sad, Idk if this is depression or what but whatever. Sorry. I just wanted to spread my feelings as I have no one to truly give myself out to. I mean it's the internet.

      "text": "We need help, both my boyfriend and I are suicidal. Both my boyfriend and I have been struggling our whole lives with depression, as well as a whole range of other psychiatric disorders. We're both doing very very bad lately. He gets so depressed at times that he almost never leaves the bed. He doesn't talk to anyone, not even to me. He has hit rock bottom now.He was extremely sick with depression and suicidal thoughts half a year ago, then he got better for a while and we were both doing amazingly, and now shit is going down again. When he was as bad as this the last time half a year ago he never got out of bed, never went out, we never had sex, and everything was hell. I didn't go to work or go out at all because I was constantly afraid that I would find him dead when I got home. I myself have never been so close to committing suicide as I was at that time.The thing is that he NEVER asks for help or tells anyone about his struggles. We both go to therapy, but he isn't honest with his therapist and just tells her that he is doing fine. He tells everyone that he's doing fine, and everyone believes him, because he keeps his mask on until he is home. So I am the only one who knows how he's really doing, because I am the only one who sees it, since I live with him. I am struggling with my own illnesses as well, but I sort of have to try and ignore my own mental health because I need to make sure he's doing ok enough to survive. I know it sounds like the dumbest thing to do in these situations, but I always priortize the problems of people I love over my own. So basically, as well as dealing with my own stuff and suicidal thoughts, I also carry his problems in hopes that it might help him. I am desperate to help him, but I don't know how. And I don't know how I'm gonna do it and stay sane and survive myself. It's so dificult to deal with this all alone, I have no one to go to.We did survive the last time, but I don't know if we're gonna survive this time, we barely made it out alive the last time. I can't handle another round of this, it will be the end of me, and of him as well.What do I do? He won't get help himself, I've tried to help him ask for help himself, but he never does. But I NEED HELP. I can't handle this, it's too much and it's killing me. I can't stop thinking that if I die first then I won't have to watch him go and be left behind all alone and live with the pain of losing him. I know that there's a limit to what I can do for him to help, and that I can't cure him in any way. That's why I need someone else to step in and help us, we can't handle this on our own.I don't know who to talk to, everyone I've asked for help hasn't cared and just ignores me. Can I contact emergancy help? Can I do that even if he hasn't really tried to commit suicide yet, it's just that I suspect he will soon? Btw, I live in Norway, so the support systems may be different here than they are whereever you guys live, so I don't know how much help I can get from here.I just need advice, I have no one to talk to. I feel like I'm supporting the weight of both him and myself, and I have to carry him on my shoulders as I try and live my life normally, doing daily tasks. As if I am stuck on the ground with him laying unconcious on top of me so I can't get out, and I'm screaming for help but nobody hears me or just ignores me and walks by.I need him to get help, so that I too can get help. I feel like I can't focus on myself and my own mental health at all unless I know he's getting help first. I am almost at my limit, planning my suicide so I have a way out if I come to realize there is nothing I can do and we're gonna be stuck like this. I'd rather die than live like this, it feels like my head is going to expload, I can't even eat anything because I am so sick all the time with headaches and nausea because I am so scared he might die any second. I haven't eaten in days now, I can't eat. It just comes back up again, I can't stomach anything anymore. I need help. Sorry if this is too long.Btw we both go to individual therapists and we're on a variety of different antidepressants and antipsychotics, but the meds doesn't do shit and our therapists suck. We've both had so many therapists now I've lost count. I'm starting to think there is no help out there that works.",

Just for conversation, not being judgmental about it. I read the first book in 89 I think. I was in high school, and just discovering Stephen King. I loved it and became one of those annoying Dark Tower fans that anxiously awaited him getting around to publishing a new installment. Before Wizards and Glass, I thought maybe he had given up on it. Then, that book was such a departure, I sort of lost some of the magic of it. After that, there was sort of radio silence on the rest of the story. The world moved on and I thought maybe that was all we would get. Years went by and suddenly all the rest was published. I attempted to read Song of Susannah but it seemed like he was just trying to finish the thing. I didn't finish the book and never read the rest. I just wonder if it's worth slogging through to recapture to thread or if the rest was a disappointment? My fear is that like Roland, the world has moved on, and so has Stephen King. Time changes perspective and people, leaving things stranded at way stations. Maybe he waited too long and the man who began the journey isn't the same one who completed it.",

Not just \"We can't afford computers or consoles\" level of poverty, I mean scraping around underneath sofa cushions for 10p's to try and get some bread and milk.But I was happy. It taught me to appreciate what little I had and not to worry about what I didn't have. And that's how things were for the first 15 years of my life.In 2014, not long after we moved house, my mother became friends with a man from down the road and in the summer of last year he invited her out to play Pokemon Go. They admitted that they loved eachother, within a few months he'd moved in and in March they'd sent off marriage forms.So, my mother had a man who loves her, a nearly 18 year old daughter getting ready for uni, a 15 year old trying with his GCSE's, and a 13 year old figuring out what his options'll be. Surely this should be the most exciting time as a parent?Apparently not as on the 10th of March, the day after they sent off the marriage forms, Mum killed herself. She didn't leave a note and didn't say goodbye in any way. She just went out \"to the shop\" and never returned.At that point social were scrambling to figure out what to do with us and the rent situation. But it's alright, we have the fiance to look after us.Come mid April he's decided he doesn't care about us. And instead of giving us a warning, he just packs up and leaves. The first thing we knew about it was social calling my sister to let her know, that she wouldn't be able to look after my 13 year old brother and I and so we'd be put into a foster home. It took a month for us to be moved because my brother and I literally cannot share a room and we had to be near a train station so we could visit my older brother and sister.So I was forced to move 23 miles away to a town I'd never even heard of into a house with upper class cunts who think everyone should be exactly like them who make me pay for literally everything from clothes to the light bulb in my room to pens and pencils myself despite them not letting me look for even a summer job in a cornershop and to a school full of upper-middle class people who've OBVIOUSLY never had to go without anything and look down upon the poor. I had to try and explain to someone in my art class what hunger is and what it feels like!The biggest factors in my final decision are that people live like this while others like my mother kill themselves or even starve to death in Britain because they're barely even earning a quarter of the poverty line, and that is my future. That's what I have to look forward to.Here's why; I left school at 11 to start helping my mother more because of her depression making things hard for her but I just ended up not having the time for home-ed so I will have no qualifications. I can't be around people, I can't praise myself (so a CV's gonna be impossible) and I'm so fat amateur football clubs turn me down as a goalie despite being better than (or at the very least turning up more consistently than) their starting keeper. The lack of playing made me fatter and sadder because I started comfort eating and now I can't stop.And in the past few weeks I've noticed myself waking in the early hours of the morning with a notebook on my lap, a pen in my hand and another page of the thoughts I keep firmly locked inside my head for the most part, just sprawled across another page. Stuff like \"I am not me. It's all just other people's versions of me\", \"I have lost touch with who I really am\", \"How is life a gift? Answer me that, Christians\", \"People are dying of starvation in Britain while [foster carer's names] stuff their pockets\", \"People like me shouldn't exist\", \"These are the voices I live with 24/7/365! GET THE FUCK OUT OF ME PLEASE\" Ooh, a page here that just says \"FIX ME PLEASE!\", \"Please help me! Please I don't know what to do!\", half a page of \"The end is never the end is never the end is never the end\" just looping (which I swear I've heard somewhere before) followed by half a page of \"I'm scared\" over and over again, \"Don't come near me! I SAID STAY BACK! For your own good! Please help me, mummy\", \"Why am I this way?\" and \"I'll show you! I'll show you all!\" on the same page, and \"I'm not scared anymore. I'm ready for my final dance!\" and that's just the highlights. I swear to the-nonexistent-God I'm not making this up.The only thing that's held me here for so long is the thought of it being my brother to find me lifeless, but now I just don't care. And don't tell me I don't know what's right for me. I've still got about 50-60 years left if I don't end it and that's if I try everything (in vain) to fix my future. I don't want that long in the same poverty I've grown up in. Unlike my mother, I can't make �40 last a week. And I don't care how selfish suicide is. I am selfish.Thanks for reading, even though I know you're rolling your eyes at the thought of yet another depressed teen on here.",

Hey guys, I don't know if many people read my other posts but there's more (descriptive wise.) if you want to read more, and i'm not gonna go link it or anything. It's pointless. Today even though its only 11:29 and I woke up around 10:00 is one of my hardest days yet. I'm having an intense emotional breakdown and if you saw me in person you'd think I was completely fine. Everything is hurting, my heart my mind, physically I am in a lot of pain right now also. I'm so sad, so extremely sad that I feel like i'm going to throw up. I miss my fiance, and he's 3 feet away from me. I miss my family, and they do nothing but treat me like garbage. I miss school, and I HATED it, I was miserable there, so miserable that it escalated the depression where I was genuinely scared I would kill myself. But now its like... I feel like I don't have a purpose in life, I don't want to go to a new school I'm absolutely dreading it. I don't want to get a job, I don't want to clean up after myself. Fuck i'm having a hard time getting in the shower and cleaning myself and not just sitting down and crying. I'm an emotional wreck right now. I'm mentally drowning in my thoughts and I feel like everyone around me is too fucking selfish to notice it. Everyone is selfish, everyone wants me to do what they want for them. I can't even begin to explain it all, just know that's sincere, people in my life are EXTREMELY selfish towards me, constantly. Even now, when i'm sick i'm being pushed to do things for other people. I'm sorry this post is cluttered and very sporadically spaced out, not much of a proper lay out. I'm just venting, I don't feel like properly going through and fixing all of this today. Last night I had a mental breakdown, so bad that I sobbed for hours. Every little thing feels like i'm being slapped in the face, my mother in law could look at me the wrong way and I would cry. I'm extremely easily agitated right now, and i'm so just ughhh. I'm so immensely exhausted and realistically I have no reason to be. My heart hurts, and It shouldn't but it hurts so bad I can feel it breaking more and more on a daily basis. Does any of this make sense? I want to kill myself, I want to die.. but I'm too much of a chicken to go through with it. There's literally days where i'll pray for a car accident, or a freak occurrence to just take me. I feel like i'm worthless to everyone I love, I feel like everyone looks at me as though I was a burden.. Which I am, that's not wrong I just... I don't know guys. I'm sad.I hope you're having a better day than me.Be safe.",

The weariness that can creep up in life can be so paralizing. Despite this paralisis, the light that the father and son carry is one that is utilized, not merely symbolic. It is important because it is light used to iluminate the way for the other. Like a burning torch combusting the material or the limited amount of fuel it is dipped in, the father's body takes a toll. Burning, bein used up.The light isn't merely a signifier to identify one self. \"Carrying the light\" is taking action to make the world a bit brighter for some one else at the cost of oneself.I am so grateful to have my wife, my parents, sibling, and even my cat, who light the torch for me, and even more so for the power they instill in me to light the torch for them.",

I found out recently that he had been cutting and having suicidal thoughts for a while now, which he let slip over the course of a few conversations, but always refused to talk about it further. Whenever I ask him if he is ok he always says he is, but he obviously isnt. He never wants to tell me anything. He's also been doing a lot of drugs, but I'm not as worried about that. I am worried that he doesn't feel like he can tell me these kinds of things. I feel like I have failed him as a friend somehow, because I am his closest friend that lives anywhere nearby and I can't help him. I really don't know what to do. I don't want to force him to talk about it if he doesn't want to, but I also care about him more than most people in the world and want him to be happy, and I don't think doing nothing will cut it.

Stuff was rough the first time, We weren't really anything, we were friends, but i liked her, i managed to work up the courage to confess, and what she said, shocked me, she told me, that she liked me back, and we became together, for a year, till everyting suddenly went away, like it's nothing. It all started when, I was feeling a bit disregarded from her, she hangs out with her friends alot, like everyday, all since school started, we havent been talking that much, and i can understand, that she's busy with school, and i was too, i was still there for her, but then i noticed she was hanging out with another guy, his name is adrian, i noticed they've been talking a lot, chatting a lot, i see them both at school alone together, obviously i got jealous, and told her abt it, she told me, that i got nothing to worry about, and that's it's all okay. I have anxiety issues, im always insecure abt myself, but now especially her, bc shes always with this guy who's she's been hanging out with so much, i feel like they're always something else, i always asked her, always clarifying nothing's happening, but then... I asked her the one night, if i could call her, she said no bc she was \"busy\" with school stuff, but in reality, she was in a call with adrian, I knew bc i tried to call her, after two hours of waiting, i called her again, she was still in the same call, i couldn't believe she could blatantly lie like that, face to face with no shame, then i called her out on it, and she said she wont lie again, byt the next few days, she'll do it again, i tried rationalizing everythng, maybe they're just hanging out, maybe theyre doing school things, but my garbage brain would always, tell me there's something else, there's always happening, im always anxious abt her for some reason. the next following days i said to her that i want her to talk her more, like what she did with adrian, somehow this made her feel grounded, or chained up, and she said she was miserable, idfk know why, and she said she was depressed and all of this excuses, she ended it off with i dont wanna be with u anymore, and she said that she cant be with someone, bc she cant take the weight, man u dont fucking know how hard i took that, when she told me, i allowed her, next few days, I found out, she and adrian, got together, and i feel like shit, i feel so worthless, i gave her everything. Imagine if you had a girlfriend for a year, you got kinda jealous of this \"friend\" then she makes shit excuses, that shes depressed, and she cant handle a relationship anymore, then next few days, she got together, with the person you're scared with. It just hurts so fucking bad.It doesn't end there, I have abusive parents, my dad would always hit me, when he sees me crying bc im weak, and my mom simply doesn't care abt me, instead of supporting me, theyd always shame me, and make me feel bad in the worst possible way, and i cant take them anymore.I want to hurt Sarah, mentally, make her feel the same pain that i felt from her I want to stop existing, bc there's nothing to live for anymorethanks for reading, i hope, i get happy soon",

If I went to her place and she called the cops I'm sure I could get one of them to do it for me.She told me \"I want to keep my options open. There are a lot of things you do that I could still find different and better from others. I want to discover more. I want to meet others too. I don't want to be frusterated at your character more. I don't want to hold myself down. I am not in a clear place. I need to clear my head and heart. I don't think I love you right now.I am frusterated and confused at what to do\"I'm obviously disposable anyways and that fact will never ever change. I just wish I had the strength.My parents have instilled so much guilt in me that it's holding me back. I wish I could forget about it and pull the trigger.Or if I tell her my intentions she would probably make the call, they'd find me one way or another and same would happen.I'm so fucking tired of this every single day. It takes me hours to get out of bed and hours to fall asleep I can't do this shit anymore.I would lay down my life for her but my existence is repugnant to her now. I'm fuckin worthless.I keep wishing I could flip my car or I wish this plane would just fall out of the sky.I never really understood why my friends did this in the past but now I completely understand. I just wish I had the balls they did. And people get over it anyways, eventually they forget and no one ever talks about it.",

One of the two ghosted on me two years ago. The other is busy all the time, and I still find myself afraid to ask her to hang out because I don't want to put more pressure on her.I've never had a girlfriend. I'm still a virgin. Up until a month ago I hadn't even kissed a girl. When I finally did, I was convinced that I finally figured things out and that I was going to get to have the exciting, blossoming social life that eluded me for the entirety of my time in college. But now, since going back to school (but still living the same distance from me), she's become pretty clearly disinterested in having any sort of relationship with me. And I'm left staring down the barrel of another holiday season spent by myself, in my room, drowning myself in media to distract from the reality of my own existence.I just don't see how things are going to get any better. College - the best chance I had to make friends and build a social life - has passed me by. I have no personality. I'm a timid bundle of nerves. From where I'm at now, it's hard to imagine ever meeting someone who's interested in me for more than a week. All the material comforts in the world can't get me past the loneliness and shame I feel over this. I've tried.So I'm left wondering what the point is in continuing with life if I'm probably going to stay as isolated as I have been over the last four years. The holidays are always the hardest time for me. Going out now and seeing Halloween decorations, knowing that I have nobody to share this time with, just wears on me so much. I already feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and we aren't even halfway through September.",

      "text": "Apparently, I'm running an art cartel. This is ridiculous, my lawyer is out of town until the weekend. Until I see him, is there anything specific I should worry about with this whole craziness?Small tourist town, Pennsylvania. I run a gift shop that has a small gallery space for local artists work. Two friends own art galleries within three blocks. We work together to run promotions similar to \"first Friday\" in larger cities. We also split advertising in flyers showing each of our current showing. Mostly though, we will recommend the other galleries as each of us has a different proffered art type.A guy moved into the area who owned a high end gallery in a city, who Ill call John. Opens a small gallery in town as his retirement job. We reached out to him to try to include him in the local arts community, but he turned us down rudely. John has been doing poorly. From my perspective it's because most of the work he shows is priced out of the local market and he tends to act rudely to customers.He has become antagonistic towards us. John has started posted ads that attack us for not having \"real art\", etc. He has been quite vocal about badmouthing us to anyone who comes in his gallery. So far, we have just let him bury himself in bad business practices and haven't responded in any way.However, things came to a head this weekend, The other galleries and I held a promotion in conjunction with Halloween festivities and parade on Friday. He was seen pulling down our flyers around town last week. Most local shops stayed open late that night and had sales or promotions, but John's gallery was noticeably closed the entire day Friday and Saturday. In the morning Sunday John posted on his personal Facebook saying the other local galleries trashed his shop front. Later in the day a local police officer came by to ask me about it. I know the police officer and he basically said the pictures he was shown were candy wrappers and litter by the door, similar to what was left all along the parade route. The officer said he had no reason to think we were involved or that it was malicious, but he wanted to follow up and settle the issue.I was told the next day John posted and then deleted numerous complaints on Facebook against other local businesses, but especially me and the other three galleries. He has even given us a nickname, which sounds like an old west group (think \"The Three Banditos\"). I can't see John's posts but was sent two screenshots and told there was worse. On Monday, two of my friends galleries had printed flyers taped to their doors overnight, blasting them for selling cheap art and for pushing new galleries out of the community. I'm told there were also angry posts on Facebook saying that an artist who had decided to pull from his gallery, which he blamed on us. None of us know this artist, nor had any contact.Which brings us to this morning. I get a call saying that John was at a local coffee shop trying to get people to give him money to mount a lawsuit against us. He apparently had a document he typed up with his grievances. He is claiming that I specifically am running an art cartel! (Hence the post title). That two of the other shops have flooded the market with low end art to destroy his business. John was hassling patrons for money so much he was asked to leave before cops were called.I think Johns business is doing poorly and he is going a little crazy. I think the worst he could do is drag us into a pricey lawsuit that goes no where, but I want to make sure there's no other trouble he could make for us. Is this dire enough to bring in a lawyer before I speak to mine on Tuesday?Slight update: One of the gallery owners who had something taped to their food Monday met with their lawyer today. He let me know his lawyer is writing a cease and desist. His lawyer passed along similar recommendations to here: collect any evidence, get a security camera, and see if this blows over. I'm still meeting w my lawyer Tuesday, and have people friended to John in Facebook watching for any new posts. I'm probably going to just see if my lawyer will also do a cease and desist, but otherwise I'm just going to stay back and watch.",

My parents have always hated me, and have always made me feel like shit. It used to be bearable because I had friends that acted like my family, and were always there for me.One by one, they started leaving. This is where I was this summer, and why I tried to kill myself then. Now, everyone's gone. The last time someone texted me was three days ago, and it was just to ask about a homework problem. The last time I received a Snapchat was over two weeks ago. I am no one's go to person, and no one would be upset if I was dead. My family's never cared, and now I don't have any friends.Usually when people attempt suicide, they look back at it and realize why it was so dumb. But I just wish it had worked. If things don't start looking up, I'm probably going to try again soon, and make sure that it fucking works this time.",

I have friends, but they all think I'm dumb. They know I have issues, but they think they're so innocent. They think my insecurities are about my appearance or height or difficulty talking to girls or some other normie shit. And of course, if I want them to be my friends I can't straight up tell them what's really on my mind. I have to pretend to have other issues. I have a couple friends that I pretend I'm secretly gay to, another few that think I'm trans, some that think I'm just anxious, because whenever they think they figured me out I run with it because I'm terrified of anyone actually where I truly come from. I have dumb friends that think I'm just dumber than them, and I have smart friends that think I'm too smart for my own good. I hate that the only way I can stay sane and socialize is to pretend to be all of these stupid fucking normies. And they give me all this stupid advice that I could have just gotten looking at quotes on instagram, none of which, btw, have anything to do with accepting yourself when you literally gave up and ate shit at age 12. The ones that think I don't think about things are the hardest. I'm in this mess because I thought about things too much, and I still do. Nobody has ever written a song about being so lonely and depraved as a fucking middle schooler that ate their own shit. My friends think I don't really care about music because I don't bother to listen. I listen, I just haven't heard a song that sings anything relevant. Even inspirational people. Well nobody remotely remarkable's rock bottom seems to be even close to a 12 year old manufacturing their own intimacy by eating shit. Pro tip: If you can't get normal sex, just warp your budding sexuality into something that you can get! Then when it solidifies and becomes part of you, you will never have to worry about getting off again! Hate yourself for it and regret it? Even bigger turn on since you can get off to that feeling!I keep running away from people, and as I get older it's getting harder and harder to start over. I transferred colleges before last year, and honestly as much as I feel like I want to preserve my relationships and make new friends, I feel so guilty that I have to lie to them and trick them into thinking I'm not a disgusting subhuman being. They don't get why I act the way I do. The only talent I have is writing code. I fucking hate that I'm so good at it that everyone assumes I must be fine. Like, a kid who can shit out so much fucking code isn't a red flag for someone desperately trying to figure something out? But everyone just keeps praising me and giving me money and I feel like I don't deserve a reward for being the most fucked up 20 year old. Toys will keep me entertained for a while, and with plenty of money and very few friends thankfully I can afford them. But I don't see the point in living if the monster that is the real me has to stay locked away. I just leave a path of confused, possibly hurt people. The world doesn't need that.",

I related to him so well, that I even harsh a bit. I really want to apologize, but I don't know how to word it.I found out he's in this discord group chat, but scared that he will get mad at me. Please help! I really am on the verge of ruining an amazing friendship. He means a lot to me, he doesn't mind me venting. But, I made things out of hand and caused this to be like this. It is my fault that I did this, I just don't know how to properly fix this. All I do is cause more damage and hurt others.

Everyone just seems to want to talk about themselves so I just stopped talking about myself completely for years. For example I play a few instruments and they don't even know I'm into music at all. The thought of having someone else beside me or just to hang out, just seems so good to be true. No one will ever come to see me because they actually like me and care to see me. I even changed my looks dramatically to try and attract more people. Lost a ton of weight, got fit, got teeth straightened and whitened, started wearing makeup, made myself \"good looking\". No one cares. I try my best to smile most of the time and make eye contact with people (which was very hard for me because I have severe social anxiety). No one cares. My dog is the only one who seems genuinely happy to see me every single day. He's my best friend. My only friend. No one will ever show me the unconditional love he's shown me. But it isn't enough. I am always alone. No one to share my thoughts with but myself. I feel like I'm a prisoner in solitary confinement. I have a very strong urge to kill my self. Like tonight.

For example if a Terror Olog swung a giant chain in a circle rather than a cone in front of him like an Uruk, or a Feral Olog just did one giant attack with a single claw. What're your guys' thoughts on this?",

      "text": "I hate humanity for it's inability to be realistic, progress, and care about something other then its self. In some ways I would argue that I'm from another galaxy. I don't believe it but it's possible. Everyday all I see is the selfish, hypocritical, double standard falsehood that is humanity. I believe it is our job as humans to band together and only serve the earth. In reality things like politics, religion, drugs, money, alcohol, and too many things too name don't matter. It is only important if we say it is. All life is equal and the food chain only exists to humans to make ourselves feel better about not being the strongest or the fastest. We can't stop nature from killing each other and that is ok but instead we can work on the planet to make it stronger and breath easier and give strength to all living creatures. Instead humans focus on celebrities, false idols, killing \"annoying creatures\" simply because most deem them annoying. We have been given a gift to help most beautifully and time and time again we pretend that only humans are important. Maybe our only purpose is to properly help the planet, universe, and everything we can. Not to be martyrs but because it's only right. I don't need a higher power to tell me how to behave and neither do you. This is not a slight at religion but about how people worry about nonsense when instead we can do what's right. It's also not about right and wrong as it simply is not opinion that helping out around the globe for the globe can only be great! Yet the sespool that is humanity doesn't try, care, or seem to have time. I hate to be conscious because of the unfortunate group of people that I share a species with. I care not to be with you people and sometimes I wish someone would end my time so I don't have to be aware of the opportunity squandered by humanity. Yet I live for the only thing I hate. I believe that one day people will change. I have never met anyone who feels the same. I can't escape my conciousness for who knows why. It's 24/7 and I want it to stop. I won't do anything even when this post is forgotten but maybe if someone out there feels the same then know your not alone and I'm out there fighting with you my brothers and sisters.",

I'm 19 and still find it difficult to read adult books, simply because 60% of them are erotica & have half naked men on the covers.It's really hard to find adult books without reading about sex and shit; not saying all adult books are like this. Most adult books are contemporary and that's really boring, because I'm reading to escape the real world already. I don't want to read any sad adult books either, I want fantasy & action without NSFW shit. YA fantasy hits right at home. So stop judging people, we can read whatever the fuck we want.",

      "text": "25 Years Old, Virgin, Constant Highs and Lows, just want it to stop. Hello all,I found this thread by just googling other's experiences and perhaps I felt a slight hint of relief knowing I am not the only going through this. I thank whoever in advance that takes the time out of their day to read and reply to this thread.I am 25 years old, and have been dealing with depression since I was in middle school, as early as 2005. My first actual depression started with my first rejection of a female crush. Ever since then, I was just told by therapists, teachers, and former friends to just live your life, stop looking for it, and it will happen. I don't consider myself too socially awkward, and I'm told I am a very nice guy, girls would be lucky to have me etc. The rejection continued, a few dates here and there, temporary happiness of late night talks, then I get told I should just be a friend. Over and over again. Now at this point, people would usually say \"what's wrong with being a friend?\" Nothing! I love to have female friends. Issue has always been that girls who tell me they like me as a friend usually have just end up having me as \"free food\" in their phones, or just to have a ride from a nicer guy. I am just done with it, I am tired of people pretending to want to be my friend and don't bother answering when giving out their contact, and feeling like this will never happen. After I graduated high school in 2010, nothing continues to change. I enlisted in the Air Force, where I spent 5 years and still feel alone. Temporary friends, and nothing new. Just spending time off work staring at the 4 walls again. After relocating once I got out of the Air Force, I moved from Boston to Omaha and I am still seeing nothing new. Same lonely nights, starting college, and felt like this was a new beginning, but again, people, no everyone who pretends to be my friend always have so much better things to do than spend any time with me. I honestly would just rather die than turn any older and grow to be a 40-year-old virgin. Please know that I do not wish to do, and want a better life, but at the rate it's been since I was a little kid in junior high, I can almost easily say I can see the future. Nothing new will happen tomorrow, nor next week, nor the week after. I have tried almost everything. Going out alone to bars, joining clubs at college, dating apps. This feeling of being alone forever is a slow, painful way to keep living.I keep being told, confidence, confidence, love yourself. I do, at least to the best I can. I try my best to still keep myself in shape when feeling depressed, try to better myself and I don't see anything changing. I just want to be able to wake up one day and say \"wow, I made it through all those years of feeling terrible, and I'm so glad I made it through\". I know, I will never be able to say that if I go through with it, but I feel like that's a whole lot better than saying \"well I tried to press through all those years and the end result is the same\". I feel like I ask for far too much out of life, and I stopped believing in religion due to the trauma I have endured. Thank you all for reading, please be as direct, honest and brutal as you feel the need to. There is nothing more I can hear that can hurt me more. I have already been told by people I should just go ahead and do it from girls that pretended to want to get to know me, and laugh at my personal problems.",

The deal was that we decide after a month is over which would also be a more suitable time as there would be no school.At the end of the month I noticed that she still had some issues and she was worried from the exams so I waited but still made sure to show the signs of my decision, she went to a trip with her friends and got good grades on her exams so I figured this is the most suitable time, unfortunately I was in a different town when she confronted me via sms about this issue, and I confirmed that I want to end the relationship, she tried to propose we take a break for 2 month and try again then, but I refused as I knew my mind was set for some time now.She told she still loved me and maybe I will miss her a few hours after our conversation, I immediately called two of our mutual good friends on campus who were already aware of the breakup since I didn't want her to be alone (they went to see her right after our talk but left after a while), they're currently in the hospital as she tried to overdose, her condition is stable but they don't know if she will have some long term damage and I'm not fully aware of all the details.I don't know what to do, am I supposed to be there for her now or am I supposed to stay away, I made this happen and I need to take responsibility but I don't know what to do now and later, before the suicide talk we talked about staying friends so I could continue to support her in any way I can but now I realize she didn't really mean it and was just grasping for a chance to change my decision...",

All they made me feel was numb and alone at the same time. I felt like a third person, watching myself live life. When I went away to college, I started feeling better. I met a girl that showed me happiness was possible, and it was the first time in my life I felt genuinely loved by someone because of who I was as an individual, and not because of relation. That joy was fleeting though, shortly after being together the depression came back. but i wasn't suicidal anymore. flash forward years later and the suicidal tendencies and thoughts crept back into my head. Two months ago, she realized she couldn't deal with it anymore after 4/5 years together and broke up with me. Now I feel all alone. The only person that could pull me out of my worst spots is gone. She was also the one that would push me to do something with myself when I felt helpless, and would try as hard as possible to make me happy, even if it was just for a moment. She was my best friend and my lover in one. I always told her she was the best thing that ever happened to me and would try as hard as I could to make her feel appreciated. But now weeks after our breakup, I still keep in contact with her, but she said she only ever feels sad when she sees me. That, coupled with the rumors I hear about what she's doing nowadays hurts, so I don't know if talking to her is a good idea anymore. I love her still, and I feel my best talking to her, but I can't bear the impact I have on her and how I feel afterward. She isn't the source of the depression, nor is she the source of these tendencies I have. I just felt like sharing that because now I don't know who I can lean on and what to do for myself. I want to get better, but I fear that it's too late for me. I really just want someone to talk to and lean on. I've been so panicky, anxious, stressed and lonely, what freaks me out the most is that thinking about suicide is the only thing that relaxes me. It helps me stop thinking about what's wrong in my life and how I feel. It's the only way I fall asleep at night. Please help reddit, any advice is more than welcome, and feel free to PM me",

Yes there are people who do understand and they are here. I have been receiving therapy, but the people here have been my support. No therapist or feel good guru will be able to help like those who actually went through hell and back. Please give them a chance, even if you don't believe in yourself, there are total strangers out there that just want you to be happy.Today is heritage day in my country. So I'll be drinking a beer to all of you. I wish good fortune for all that visit here. Both seeking help and those giving it.See you later Totsiens Tot ziens Auf wiedersehen Shalom Au Revoir Do svidaniya Sl��n",

      "text": "Can Auto-Disassemble Machines be changed to hold 650,000 of items that disassemble 50 at a time, instead of 13000? Currently the machines only hold 13000 maximum of items such as broad arrows, but it disassembles 3000 of these per hour, whereas its only 60 items per hour for regular items, such as magic shield bows. It's extremely annoying to check these every 4-5 hours if you have millions of ammo to disassemble. The capacity change I suggested would make sense because (13000/60)*3000 is 650,000. Would be a great and niche QOL update for a lot of people. Thoughts?",

Don't do it you've got so much to live for!\" I am in a very confusing situation. I've been depressed for 2 and a half years. My stepdad attacked me, I'm always negative, my mum seemed to hate me and told me she was \"f***king sick of living with me\" always swore and shouted at me constantly. Moved to my dads as a change/ fresh start. I have siblings here I get on better with than at my mums, but I'm still not that close. I've had no friends for years, I contemplate suicide daily. I just stopped cutting but its hard. I dont get pleasure from things anymore. I never have any energy or anything. My dad knows and he wants me to get counselling and anti depressants. (Suicide also runs in my family, my dad attempted, my uncle did twice and my auntie three times, as well as my cousin self harming and being really depressed for years) And so many times I've been that close to doing it. But I don't want to die- I want things to change. But it feels like they never will. I've given up. It's very confusing. I get bullied at school and told to kill myself all the time. I get that high school relationships are pointless and mean nothing, but it would be nice to not be the only one in my form to not have been asked out. Mainly because everyone hates me. Sorry, I'm rambling here, I just don't know what to do.",

      "text": "Wizards Flavor is on Point with the Vampires I was thinking about the W/B vampire flavor for Ixalan and thinking about the real life parallels that are being drawn between them and the Spanish Conquistadors, and I think Wizards was both very purposeful and successful in addressing a particularly controversial issue in a critical manner. Especially considering that Seattle was one of the first major cities to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous People's Day.Firstly, the tribe that was chosen for the Conquistadors is very tongue in cheek. The vampires are arriving in the \"new world\" to suck blood and steal treasure. Much like real life Conquistadors, which were there to subjugate native peoples and steal what they had (Treasure, land, people).Secondly, the color pie choice is fantastically appropriate. White/Black implies order, yet selfishness and greed, which accurately represents the Europeans bringing \"Civilization\" to the native kingdoms, which actually meant upending local religions, and destroying any existing political structures. Thirdly, [[Adanto Vanguard]] is a great example of art that plays on the idea of the abuse and lack of care for the native life. The Europeans didn't care for the natural beauty of the America's, and instead attempted to \"tame\" the lands to better serve what they needed, much like this vampire killing the beautiful dinosaur because it is \"dangerous\", even though the Sun-Kingdom has been living in harmony with dinosaurs for who knows how long. Anyway, I think Wizards has done a great job taking controversial material from real life and representing it in a manner that takes a critical view on world history. Props to the flavor team and the work they put into this set. It seems to have been done very well.",

Like what, a dog?, a lesser human? Fuckers! I only know that I was only born by mistake, don't even know what the hell am I living for, not a clue why is this worthless God's creation is doing here, like a fucking defect.

I hated, still hating, will hate myself in every fibre of my being. I'm wasting time by doing nothing but looking world events with so much rules and confusion. I stare up the ceiling each day when I wake up, its like I'm chocking, drowning or already dead on the inside, living mute. Can't remember when I was happy and really felt in my place. Wished I was never born, wished I never existed. I always wished that. Maybe it'll make everyones lives easier when I'm not around, in the grander scheme of things. I knowing my contributions, ideas or my worth was never valued by anyone. I know everyone will be traumatised by my own death and its consequences, but eventually everyone will move on. I can only see all human beings are mean and judgemental, it has been a part of our human nature. We create pointless rules that none of us are able to get by. And besides, global warming :/Its like I'm ready to send out resignation letter to Life/God and sending out my proposal to Death/Grim Reaper - wanting to end my life, the sooner the better.

I broke up with my ex of last year after it turned out he was an abusive manipulator and also quit my retail job due to mental emotional stress. I've been trying to find job in my artist field as either a character designer or comic/storyboarder but nothing comes up - applications that meet my reasonable ability and where i can live go unanswered. I don't know what to do. I've been told that it's about connections, not the applications that lands you a job and I don't have that, god knows I've tried to reach out to people in the industry i look up to but I never get a response. I was a college dropout due to not having the money and being rejected twice from my desired program. I've been kind of drifting along for those years, doing what I can in hope I'll get noticed and be offered a job. Then i met my ex and for 5 years i wasted time and money on him when I could've used that towards bettering my career and more independence. I feel like a fuck up, nothing I ever do works out or pans out. I'm still living with my parents, I want to live on my own and have a decent job but im having trouble with that. I cant even fathom the idea of an emotional support animal becuase im terrified it will end up ignoring me, being actual trouble that i'll have to rehome it or get so sick that im unable to do anything about it. I dont know what to do - i've thought about killing myself but i cant do that becausei m scared and would rather peacefully in my sleep but my body taunts me everyday by waking up and its a sin to take one own's life in god's eyes. I just want a fucking job in my art career field of my dreams and i dont know if i can even fucking do that because I've tried to help myself and nothing came out of it, no one will give that additonal help to get me closer to that goal - i feel like everything is a waste. Another reason i guess i havent just gone and off killed myself is because i have a beautiful and sweetest LDR partner i want to meet in person someday. But its getting hard man, i dont know what to do anymore. im terrified of my parents going before me and having no home or anywhere else to fall back on. im terrified of being a failure for rest of my life.",

      "text": "Not quite at risk, but felt like this could be a safe place to vent. I don’t know where to begin or what exactly to say.I would love nothing more than to die, but I don’t quite have the guts to kill myself either. I think I’ve been depressed for a long time. I don’t remember ever not wanting to be dead and it took me until recently to realize that that’s not normal. I’m addicted to pornography. That might be a joke to some of you, but it’s not to me. This brings a lot of guilt and shame into my life. I can’t go more than a week without some form of pornography, and I don’t know how to stop. I’m also very religious, but don’t feel like this is the place to talk about religion.I’ve never had a boyfriend. I’m young, 22, but I feel like a loser. I’ve never even come close to having companionship with the opposite sex. Never even held a guy’s hand. I wish that guy’s opinions didn’t mean so much to me, but they do. I doubt anyone has even had a crush on me. It hurts to realize that you’re just not desirable. Any time I was ever told someone was interested in me it was a joke, and I can’t even being to describe the way that hurts. I’m not quite sure why I’m so undesirable either. I know I’m not a head turner, but I wouldn’t call myself ugly either. Maybe guys are just intimidated by a girl who is 6’1’’? I just started university. I should have graduated in the spring if I were a typical student, but I couldn’t start until this fall semester. Half the people I went to high school with have graduated, and the other half will graduate within the next year. I feel so behind in life and I’m not sure if I’ll ever catch up. I still live at home because I can’t afford to move out and pay tuition. I have no friends my age around here. The friends I do have are away at their colleges. The only people I talk to are the moms in my neighborhood that I grew up around. I love those women, but it’s not exactly socially satisfying to only talk with women who are more than twice my age. I’m lonelier than I’ve ever been in my life. When I’m not at school, I’m at home in my room. I don’t even have a job because I was laid off and finding a new job makes me super anxious.There’s one person that knows all about my struggles with pornography and suicidal thoughts. She’s told me to find a counselor, but I don’t quite know how to find one and tell my mom that I need one. I don’t want to disappoint anyone by telling them that I need mental help. I doubt a counselor’s ability to help me anyway. I struggle with anxiety too, and ever since I was little I ripped my hair out (trichotillomania). It sucks to think that I’ve had a brain that’s never worked right. I told this person not to worry about me killing myself because my suicidal thoughts are passive rather than active. But I’m worried about what would happen the second I start having active suicidal thoughts. I’ve held on this long without trying anything, but the way my life keeps slipping, I’m not sure how much longer I can hold on.",

      "text": "Not all that bad if you die I am quite damaged, I find joys upon upon other ppl misfortune as long as I deem it not serious enough. I dont care about anyone, not even myself on my worse days, and there's worst. Sometimes I got fixated on problems that will resolve with time, but until then I cease to be productive and functional. I have no energy to pursue things that I love, there's a part of my brain that makes excuse at every opportunity that comes and gone, and there's so many. I got trapped both in the past and future, the ghosts of yesteryear in the prison of tomorrow. You can’t escape the past demons, but you can outrun your fate. And thus in wanting to do so, I become suicidal. The ability to control your own fate by ending it at any time becomes too enticing to given up. Or maybe that’s what fate has installed for me, that I’ll kill myself someday (hopefully soon enough). Jokes on them though, I won't be able to give a fuck if I just die out of this plane of existence (please no other plane of consciousness, or else the curse of being sentient for eternity would suck so bad). The false illusion of freedom is one of the worst thing imaginable. Your future is locked into a fix state and you can’t seem to change it. No one can see the walls around you except yourself. You go around trying to find a way to tear it down but the walls impede your effort. You realize that the source of the walls is yourself, as long as you’re here, the walls will be there. You then know one way to crash it all down but the opportunity has not presented itself just yet. Yeah, not just yet. But it will someday, in a form of a gun.It’s hard to stay positive and think long term when I cant see what over the horizon. Actually that’s not true, I do see something. All the roads lead to Rome, and all I see is a bullet through the temple of my head. That’s all I see, the end of the road, and there's nothing after it. I want to get there so, so bad though. Can ramble for quite a bit here but nobody cares enough for that. Basically I feel life/consciousness is a prison and I want a way out. There's nothing interesting here. Or to be more precise, there's nothing as exciting as no longer have to think about anything forever. People keep saying life is a gift I say fuck that. The one true gift is freedom, the most intrinsic part of it. Robbing people their ability to end their lives is the cruelest of cruel crime.",

Some days I am completely bed-ridden and can't function at all because of pain. So here I am again, considering suicide. There's nobody to catch me as I'm falling. If I can't make rent, I'm homeless. If I can't make money, my marriage is down the tubes. It's hard to see your dreams fade away as you desperately try to get healthy to no avail.

I've always looked at religion in an objective point of view and I've really never got the subjective one. I'm really curious about your ways of thinking and your vision on the subject. Why do you believe? That is my question :) Please don't be offended this is just for my own personal curiosity Edit: Thank you all so much for your varied and mostly straight to the point answers. Everything is so interesting and I am really really eager to do more research on the subject. Mostly because well, I'm confused. I like to think that I think and function based on logic concrete/abstract human knowledge which is why I hope to study Physics later on. Religion is a topic that come and go often in discussions whether it's at school or at home. I hate not to be able to talk and discuss about it without having as arguments different point of views.

      "text": "Sorry if this thread is all over the place i'm just really not sure what to do... I really hate my life. I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety but have to put on a fake smile everyday for family. Recently everyday I have thoughts of suicide but have never been able to actually bring myself to do it. I guess I feel a bit guilty as both my parents have been diagnosed with cancer and I don't feel I have a right to end my life. My dad had bowel cancer from Mid 2016 but has had surgery and is doing well. We then found out Jan 2016 that my mum had leukemia and is currently still going through treatment but is doing good.This however is not when my depression began, I was sexually abused as a child in another country (my family used to go once every few years) by my cousin on multiple occasions and ended up hating going to the country but to this day I have not told my parents why. I was then bullied everyday in school for 5 years. I dreaded going on lunch breaks...sometimes I used to go to the library and pretend to read books just so that I could stay somewhere I wouldn't be punched or kicked. After finishing uni, I started an IT job which I liked at the beginning but 2 years later the job turned crap and I vowed to leave for a better job. This was the time I had found out my mum had cancer too and I quit my job to care for her and my dad but they were not too happy as they'd rather I worked that sit at home (This was about May 2017). I decided to look for another job in August 2017 and found another job but I absolutely hate it. I don't really want to quit it as I've just started and want to give it a chance. I have been to the doctors about my depression and they gave me a different anti depressants to try which worked, but in early 2017 I decided to stop taking them as I didn't want to rely on medication my whole life. They referred me to a psychology team but as I had to arrange for an appointment myself I just couldn't bring myself to it as I feel embarrassed and ashamed to talk about my past life.I don't really have any best friends to talk to deeply about this as they either do not know what to say, they think i'm lying about being depressed or they say you should talk to someone. I've rambled on but I just don't know why I really really do not like my life. I have thought about ways to kill myself but just cannot do it. I'm scared.",

      "text": "Struggling more and more each day... I've posted about how I am about to get a divorce. Long story short, I feel as if I did everything I could to be a good husband, mainly in terms of being there for her in sickness and in health. She has endometriosis and ever since we began dating, she's been dealing with related issues and I've been there for her always. Countless trips to the ER/hospital and many doctors appointments. She had major surgery on the other side of the state two years ago and I took 3 weeks off to care for her as she recoverd.She has almost always been too sick, sore, tired, or nauseous to want to do much and we haven't had much of a social life and more or less no sex life either. After the surgery, she got off a lot of her usual meds, they only caused more trouble with the side effects, and got approved for medicinal marijuana. We discussed this beforehand and I was fine with it. The pot and a new diet helped her lose nearly 50 pounds and her self esteem grew.At this point, I admit that her health problems were taking a toll on me. I felt taken for granted and unappreciated. I also was starting to struggle with depression and anxiety. My temper worsened and it drove a bigger wedge between my wife and I. She begged me to begin seeing a therapist and/or getting on antidepressants. I've done both. I realized that the marriage was at risk once my wife began hanging out with new friends and spending less time with me. Once she brought up the idea of having an open marriage, I should have realized it was over.Despite the fact that I had kept asking her if we were done, she continued to protest the idea of divorce. However, her new lifestyle centered on going out with friends, getting high, and spending a lot of time with other men. We stopped sharing a bed and more or less stopped talking. I was and still am convinced she has been cheating on me, but she still denies it. Even if she wasn't sleeping with anyone else, she still made the choice to spend her time with others, to share her thoughts and feelings with them and cut me out of her emotional mindset.She finally told me she wanted a divorce the day before her birthday, nearly a month before our 5th anniversary. I've since moved back in with my dad. She no longer will even talk to me so I can get ahold of the necessary papers so I can take responsibility for my personal debts. She's keeping the furniture and staying in the rental property we lived in, as it is owned by her uncle. She has taken my entire life from me, I have nothing, she has everything, and now she is becoming such a bitch to me that I absolutely hate her. The last 7 years of my life have been for nothing.Now I am stuck at my dad's with no internet, poor cable, and nothing of my own. I have no friends or any social life. My confidence is shot and I have so much anxiety even talking to strangers that I'm unable to work up the nerve to go out and try to make friends. I've never been good at making relationships that last. I've never had a best friend, aside from my wife. I'm lonely and bored and frustrated. I have no privacy at home, so I can't even jerk off to alleviate that frustration.Before I moved out, my wife confessed she is pansexual and polyamorous. That's fine and dandy, but she could have saved me so much heartache if she had come to that conclusion about who she truly is, before we even got engaged. I no longer feel like I can even trust another woman. From what I've seen on the couple of dating apps I've checked out, there appears to be a lot of poly/pan women out there. I am open-minded, but I am just not that \"progressive\" I guess. I'm almost 39 and many the women my age already have kids and most of them are educated and have actual careers. I work in a factory and have nothing.Getting into another relationship is not the answer for me, but I can't even get a simple hook-up if I wanted. I don't know how to talk to people and I nearly panic every time I'm in crowed places. Simply put, I feel completely inept and useless. I am miserable and unable to see anything improving. I feel, at this point, that the most productive thing I could do with my life is end it.I'm extremely pessimistic and increasingly misanthropic. I have yet to find a public space where I feel comfortable and welcome. I just sit in the library or in the corner of a bookstore just so I can have access to free WiFi and even then I find nothing of interest. I'm lost and drowning. I just lack the courage to take the steps to kill myself.I'm miserable, angry, tired, bored, lonely, and listless. Nothing seems to help. Everything is just a distraction. I really don't know what to think and I doubt anything or anyone can really help.",

I just wanted to clear those two things up before I made my final decision of giving the book a whole read, I’m bad with giving enough time to reading so I wanted to see if I would be able to stick out the whole book or if I would fall offThanks",

Frozen in pain my entire life. 31 years old I haven't lived a single day. It doesn't matter how hard I pray. Today I felt fear like I always have. Fear that my life will always be sad. No love for me. An ugly, disgusting hate filled machine. I'm not walking alone. I'm a corpse in a ditch, wrists cut to the bone. I'm a bullet hole through the side of my head. Because life is so painful I'd rather be dead. I don't care how it looks to be trash covered filth. Because that's what I am, aside from the guilt. I'm guilty of feeding this sadness and pain. I choose to be cold with a drug addled brain. Nobody loves me, not anymore. Every chance I've been given I've thrown to the floor. I live on a wheel that's attached to my heart. Every inch it turns rips me apart. The wheel is me and I am it. Consuming my soul as I turn on the spit. If I hung myself the rope would stay loose. I am so worthless I can't tie a noose. If my body were eating by wild, hungry beasts. They'd spit out the garbage and pull out their teeth. Their stomachs would burn with the horrible taste. For I am everything that everyone hates. A thousand foot fire consuming mankind. Would leave me unscathed unworthy to die. My car could be filled with poisonous smoke. But my disgusting soul would not let me choke. My feet plot against me my ankles gladly twist. For I am so hated my voice is ashamed to pass through my lips.",

The author was also the first woman to pioneer the Mississippi Delta, and her stories live up to the roughness you would imagine she would experience, but she also somehow found the best in the events of her daily life. Would 10/10 recommend.Has anyone else read it? Are there other books that you feel are a great read in the way that it's nice to listen to an old person with a crazy life-story share their experiences with you?",

Ever since Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington died this year, it has made me wonder. These guys had families and successful careers, but even then they couldn't escape depression. It made me realize I'll never be able to escape these tendencies no matter how great my life is, and that's fucking terrifying to me. I've dealt with depression and suicidal feelings for 11 years and still haven't escaped. I don't wanna get too deep into having a family if I'm just gonna kill myself eventually.

For 21 years i've been a burden for my parents, a waste of time, effort and money, in this time i haven't nor i think i could in the future give them anything back, something to make them feel all the trouble was worth it and the only thing i can offer them back is what they gave me, they gave me life and i should return it back to them, ending the burden and removing a huge weight from their shoulders. But that isn't the whole reason i'm probably doing this, it's also because i'm an ugly motherfucker, a mental illness bin, a social inept, a friendless loser, a virgin and a useless shit. Honestly i've already given up on getting a girlfriend, i never had one and i'll never have because of my ugliness and shit personality, not even tinder can help me up, i'll never have children, i don't even want to, i don't want to pass down my depression, anxiety, ugly, fucked up immune system genes, no, no child should carry this. I made some friends in high school, how i don't know, but after graduating when my depression got to its worst most abandoned me during my 2 years of recovery that followed, only 3 of them cared enough to send me a facebook message from time to time, but out of this 3, 2 barely speak to me now and 1, who i thought i could trust entirely, stopped talking to me after almost confessing to her that i was going to try to kill myself yesterday, i feel devastated, all i wanted was someone i could talk to, someone to help me. 3 times i've already tried to end it all, yesterday's was the third and as i promised myself the last, the next one, this one has to be the one. After what has happened i don't want to go back with my family, i don't want them to see me depressed again, after 2 long anguishing years of attempted recovery, i don't want any more pills and talks with my psychiatrist, i don't want to go every two weeks with a psychologist to tell me what to do and what to don't, i'm tired of all this, i don't want to \"get better\" again for no reason, i don't want to keep trying to fit in this decaying society, to live in a world going to shit and resisting any change, i'm tired of being myself, i'm tired of not having anything to look forward to, having no plans, no anything, of seeing no light at the end of the tunnel despite my efforts.Someone please help me, i just want to go back when everything was cheerfulness, when my mother sang me lullabies and i was safe from everything, when i played in the mud carelessly, when ignorance was bliss, when i was happy.",

      "text": "Americans who support or not support free healthcare, what's your reasoning behind it? Here's the problem. Insurance companies love when people give them money but hate paying money. So they are incentivized to not actually pay anything if they can avoid it. Meanwhile hospitals get to collude with each other and insurance companies to charge whatever they feel like. So they get to charge a second much as they can. So the only incentive is to make it more expensive. There's really no such thing as free, we'll all have to pay for it, I just happen to think we shouldn't be forced to pay administrators to constantly pad their pockets. As it stands now, it's like this: I pay about 35k in total living expenses (mortgage, food, car) every year; I pay 2k per MONTH in health insurance for my wife and son (both in perfect health) with a 10k deductible. With a total of almost 70k in only these two, I'd love for someone to tell me, where she the savings account? Where's the small vacation? How come I have to pay so much for so little? Instead I just get told I should be lucky I live here. I don't really care what system we decide on, something's gotta change and it's gotta make these costs come down, or I and millions of other people exactly like me are going to be in a lot of trouble",

      "text": "I need advice regarding escaping from my depressive thinking A little background before I jump into the body of what I have to say.A little over 5 years a go, I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety at the age of 13. I had known prior to that that I suffered from some form of depression or another, but I was not the type to self diagnose. My mother and bio dad had divorced when I was 4 or 5, and because of the way it came about, I blamed myself for a majority of my life. Eventually I got over that as best I could, but life continued piling on hardships, and I would say I did my best to make it worse up until about 10 months a go, when I started trying to get better. But right around then, my drug problem (Xanax at the time, along with most other things I could get my hands on) drove me to do something that ended with me in jail for a week until I bonded out. After court kept going on for a while, I was referred to a mental health court program. That was where things started getting bad again. Since then, I started talking to this girl I had dated all throughout high school again. She was in a relationship with another girl (whom she had left me for) and I was not willing to ruin her happiness. But eventually, one thing led to another and we started seeing each other more often, and we started having sex again. And then about a month a go her father died of liver failure. She and I had been particularly close to her dad, and I had to weight set on me of being her emotional support (because her girlfriend did not know how to support her, period). Within that same week my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer, and I was slowly losing my grip on my emotions (she is still alive and going to radiation treatment right now). And then, last week on the 17th (my birthday is October 17th, for a little more background) I received a phone call about one of my closest friends still in the area. He was still on active addiction, though he was not using as much as once had, and he had overdosed the night before. Two days later, on the 19th, I attended his wake and at this point was an emotional wreck. And then on Monday of this week (the 23rd) the girls girlfriend found out about us and broke up with the girl. Over the past 7 months this girl had said she would get back together with me again once she and the girl had broken up, and I thought maybe she would. I was mistaken. She said she needed space from both myself and the girl, and I was okay with this. A little sad(very sad, really) but I understood why she needed space. And then she said she needed space from me, that we wouldn't work out at this time in her life, that the girl made her happy, and that she would need space from me but would be getting back together with this girl. I was destroyed. For the first time in four years, I want to die again, and I can't see any other thing to do. TL;DR Over the past month, my ex's dad died and I was very close to him, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, my closest friend died of an overdose, and the only emotional support I've had over the past four years left me. Is there anything, aside from seeking mental health help and checking myself into a hospital (I'm seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and I've been to a hospital and it did not help), that any of you might think of doing that could take my mind off of everything that has been going on?",

      "text": "I'm a 19 year old college student and I've had this problem for my entire life. I don't know how to be open about how I feel. I was bullied and neglected by my friends throughout high school and middle school, and I feel like this and past painful experiences have made me too afraid to tell people when I'm upset or how I feel about things in general. My college friends have been nice to me, but I feel like I'm starting to be neglected by them too because I constantly feel like I'm being left out of their conversations and when we hang out they hardly talk to me. I always come up with witty jokes to make them laugh, and they often tell me how talented I am, but I feel like I'm just an entertainer to them rather than a friend. I want to be able to have real conversations with them and tell them how I feel but they always ignore me and drown me out. I have asperger's, which makes this especially difficult because sometimes they get impatient with how slow I am to say things, and also it sometimes doesn't come out quite right and they don't fully understand what I'm trying to say when I do manage to get something out. Just being around them feels so degrading. If I talk about wanting to kill myself or being depressed they think I'm just joking so they think nothing of it and carry on talking to each other. When we get drunk together is the only time I have enough courage to say how I feel, but I'm still drowned out. If I had access to more alcohol I'd probably have a serious drinking problem because the only time I feel released from the pressure of social anxiety, stress, and negative thoughts is when I'm drunk. I'm unable to ease my depression from crying because I feel like I'm no longer physically able to. It's the worst feeling, being trapped inside your own mind.Maybe I don't give them enough to work with to deserve their care or respect. I sometimes feel like I don't give them enough of my attention to deserve theirs. I think of committing suicide all the time, but I've never gotten enough courage to try it, but I feel like I won't be able to live like this for much longer, because I'll soon have to face this while dealing with trying to find a decent job and facing the world.",

I started therapy a few months ago, already been for about 14 appointments and although there have been some little improvements, I feel like that it just can't help me enough. The therapist said that what I experienced years ago is some kind of trauma and that we could work on that. These past months have been literal hell for me, having experienced another loss in my family just 3 weeks ago. Tomorrow should be the final(and most important exam) for which I have studied basically nothing. I feel like I can't go on living like this, so I decided that tonight will be where it all ends.

That is the purpose I have served. I am not sure that I want to continue is this is all that life has to offer me. Few months ago, I went to travel with my friends, not a big trip, just a one day trip. And I kept being subject of all the jokes. It felt like I was being harassed or bullied. I feel like this is not meant to be happening now, I mean we are in 20s we are not in 8th grade anymore. But it happened, and it felt terrible.This is one of the event, but I have always been an outcast, all my life, always been laughed at. I have embarassed myself, people have ridiculed me. It has been an embarrassing life. I just feel like I can't do it anymore.I love my parents and they have showered me with love all my life. So I feel torn.Also, I have bipolar disorder, have failed two colleges, used to be an engineering major, but now doing some easy arts courses in a shitty college just to get a degree. I am about to graduate in like 8-9 months. But my degree is embarrassing, I have terrible score, and I am not getting employed either after graduation. And, quite funnily, I don't know whether I am even functional enough to work.Good thing about my life is that, I was born in a fairly wealthy family, so I am not worried about poverty or anything.Also, in few years I would be arranged married, and I just hate the idea of it. I mean what if I just completely hate the person? What if the person hates me? It is basically marrying a stranger. And the people I have met in my current college, I just can't get along with them at all, what if she is one of such person?.Also, I am supposed to not tell them about my illness, but it will eventually come out, and sometimes people even want a divorce when they realize they have been lied to in arranged marriages. It is the number one reason for divorce in India, I read in an article. But on the other hand, if I tell them that I have mental illness, they will interpret it as me saying \"I am crazy!!! I am lunatic\" and they will cancel it and not give me a chance. So I would feel like I am duping someone into something.It is just a terrible feeling of not experiencing and exploring what \"love\" is but just marrying a stranger. It will just be something that happens in TV.I spend like 7-8 hours easily on the internet, feeling guilty about it, feeling like I am just wasting my life. Have not been able to study since 21 days. Just not been able to motivate myself to sit and open a book and study. Have tried but just not been able to do it.Now I don't know if I want to continue living this life of hermit. No friends, no love, no work, terrible education, mental illness.",

I'm Michael Fiegel, better known in certain online circles as aeonite. My debut novel will be out on November 7 of this year. It tells the tale of a serial mass murderer who abducts a young girl from a fast food restaurant and trains her to be a killer like him. It's sort of The Professional meets Arya and the Hound. You can check out an excerpt at or view the book trailer on YouTube at . Blackbird is my first novel, but my second published book, the first being a humor book based on a website called Ninja Burger which was an Internet cult hit back in the early '00s. The website (ninjaburger.com) started as a silly gag, but ended up spawning a series of role-playing games, a popular card game from Steve Jackson Games, and a bunch of other nonsense back when one could still get away with that sort of thing. I've also written, self-published, and co-published a number of RPG books including HELLAS: Worlds of Sun and Stone and the ENnie Award-winning Folkloric: Baba Yaga, and in the process dealt with just about every part of the publishing process, from layout, to cover design, to shipping pallets of books from China through the Panama Canal. On top of all that, I've written for Dragon Magazine, worked for a number of video game companies as a writer and community manager, and trained to be a private investigator. Lots of stuff. But you're probably here to talk about books so let's get started. I'd love to talk about Blackbird, but ask me anything. : : The official \"livestream\" portion of this AMA is coming to a close. Thanks to everyone for the great conversation. I'll be checking back to see if any more questions trickle in, or feel free to chat with me online, either on Twitter at or on Discord in .",

Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead. This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought. This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter. You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great! Just be sure to explain you liked about them too.

      "text": "Can we discuss Anna Karenina? My friends don't read things like Tolstoy... :( Well... most of my friends don't read books at all. A downside to being a member of a generation raised on the fleeting pleasures of gifs, youtube, and the like. Alas, let me step down off my high horse and get back to my point. It hasn't happened to me often, but occasionally I'll read the right book at the right time in my life, and it changes me. The me I was when I started the book is not the same me as the one finishing the book. I think Infinite Jest, East of Eden, and now Anna Karenina are the books that have done that to me. It's hard to articulate how this book made me feel. Not \"better\" per se but maybe that I'm not as alone as I sometimes feel. That there are people out there that are maybe more like me than I know. Maybe I felt like my \"soul\" was sighing a quick breath of relief. Like a little bit of the weight of the world has been lifted off. I think Tolstoy was able to make me feel this way more so than anyone else I've read because he digs so deeply into his characters' minds. He not only wrote about what they said, but the things that went unsaid. Those awkward moments that no one talks about; the strange feelings that you can't quite describe. The sidelong glance at someone you shouldn't be thinking about, but cannot get out of your mind. His writing reminded me that deep down, everyone has thoughts that they never speak of. We all have thoughts and desires that stay buried under layers of social conditioning. The people we are externally and the people we are internally are never the same person. I guess these things should be obvious, but sometimes it's hard to see the forest through all these damn trees. Like any great book, I think each reader needs to feel like the book was written for them and no one else, and through Konstantin Levin, Tolstoy achieved that for me. He wasn't writing about Levin, he was writing about me! How can this character be so much like me I wondered? It wasn't until I finished and read more about the book and about Tolstoy that I found out that Levin is sort of based on himself and his quest for meaning in life. Philosophically I feel very much aligned with Tolstoy's way of thinking, and it shocks me to think that he wrote this story in the 1800's. I often have the flawed perception that no one could have had the same thoughts and beliefs before I have, as I am a product of my time and place. Clearly I'm wrong. But sometimes it's good to be reminded of that. I'm still perplexed that ultimately Tolstoy turned to religion, but I suppose we all have our own reasons. Also, this is a silly little bit but I greatly enjoyed the quick forays into the minds of animals. I've never read an author that thought to do that. This was my favorite part: ‘Fetch it, fetch it!’ shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind. ‘But I can’t go,’ thought Laska. ‘Where am I to go? From here I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or who they are.’ But then he shoved her with his knee, and in an excited whisper said, ‘Fetch it, Laska.’ ‘Well, if that’s what he wishes, I’ll do it, but I can’t answer for myself now,’ she thought, and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the thick bushes. She scented nothing now; she could only see and hear, without understanding anything.Holy shit I wrote way more than I intended. To sum up all my word vomit: Anna Karenina is the most fitting candidate I've encountered of a Platonic ideal in the realm of novels. My lifelong quest shall be to dethrone it with that next book that is slightly more perfect. Some forms of art are timeless, and this is one that I hope will never be forgotten.",

      "text": "I've been passively planning my exit the last few years. Just need to do a brain dump now and get it out there I'm a male in his 30s, successful, healthy, people tell me they think i'm doing really well. I think almost everyone would be surprised to hear I am thinking about suicide. The last few years I have been planning my exit. I don't know when exactly i will do it, but probably before I turn 40.My friends are all married and having children, I am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work. I go to the gym a lot, I read, I have hobbies, I travel, I even moved across the country. I can improve lots of things about my life. I am a proud person and I am not helpless. Still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what I am going through. If I even hint at being depressed I get the old \"chin up, tough guy\" or people just stop calling. I also have very bad relationships with my family. I have one sibling and we will probably never speak again. Not close with my parents. I had one serious girlfriend, but we broke up years ago and I have not tried a serious relationship since then. Lots of flings and short term dating, but nothing serious and I don't think I could ever be in a relationship again.I just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live. I rarely experience any joy. I just work.. either at my actual job, or on hobbies and side projects, I am constantly working. The thing is, I like working. It gives me a purpose. Otherwise I feel like life is pointless. I have to make something out of my life. What else is there to do when you are my age? Dating is like torture to me. Everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time. I feel objectified and I never feel a connection. Sex is meaningless sensory stimulation. I enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty. The only thing I can offer women is sex or the superficial \"stability\" that women in their 30s want, basically to have a house and a car, the trappings of a \"successful life\". But that isn't what I want. I want to live a real life. I want somebody who likes books and doesn't care about bullshit. I have almost completely given up on women at this point, I'm tired of getting burned, and I don't want to date anyone i don't have a connection with.My sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection. Otherwise, i think I am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason, for decades and decades, until I am too old to work and i become useless. I can keep plucking away at some of my 'goals' for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances, friendly neighbors etc., but am I so crazy to think this isn't good enough? What is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and it's just you in a room alone?I don't want that to happen to me so I have started planning my exit. I don't feel happy about this but it seems like the only way to have dignity in the rest of my life. I don't want to be around for those decades alone. It will be torture. I am going to give myself another 5-6 years and make sure I have my ducks in a row so I can exit early if it seems like nothing is going to happen.The worst part is I can't tell anyone about this because I will be insulted and have them tell me i'm being a selfish cunt or that I'm just being \"dark\" for even thinking about giving up my perfect life. Nobody understands, i am completely alone in this world, and it looks like I always will be.Thank you for letting me get that off my chest.",

I'm heavily drugged up to the point that I'm pretty certain I'll either won't wake up or wake up to an event that will cause me to end it right then and there. The goal of the test was to prove to myself whether I'd be able to go through with 'it' or would some how find something to keep me going on this road to recovery with far too many set-backs.I've contacted the national hotline but they have told me they can only advise me so much because of the time.

For one, IT itself seems reminiscent of something that would be encountered in a Lovecraft world. A entity that can't really be explained and has existed since before time has been used by Lovecraft time and time again. What really drove this home for me was when I found out that IT's greatest nemesis was a giant cosmic turtle in space. Not only that, but there is almost a hierarchy of entities just like in the Chtulu mythos. How much of this is connected to Lovecraft, do you think King was directly inspired by him or simply grew into cosmic horror?",

My life hasn't done anything good for anyone. I guess all my friends and family members would be better off without someone constantly just causing problems and being one big problem. I feel that there's just no place for me in this world - and I have really tried looking for it. Doesn't matter where, I'm always a misfit.The best I could say about myself is that I'm probably pretty but even that I ruined with all my self harm - so there's nothing left. I feel like unwanted and useless decoration. What's it worth to be pretty if you're just a disaster besides that.People just always leave me - and if they wouldn't my fear and knowing that they will in the end ensures it - or at least the important persons, the ones I actually really care about. My life always just got better to only get even worse afterwards but I see an end soon. In the moment I don't even have the strength to properly and seriously consider suicide - because even that seems senseless - but I've recently just accepted that this will be my end. Maybe it will even last some more years but this is how it's gonna end. Every time something happens I'm a bit closer to ending it and there's not much left 'til I'll finally do it. I don't see anything left I could do. I can't have any relationships anymore. I'd like to be a person that could just focus on her career but I'm too unconcentrated, too distracted, too tired, too depressed. So I'm just existing and waiting.Not even therapists have been any help, even they don't seem able to understand me and all the 'standard' things aren't working on me. My current doesn't even want to make the diagnosis because for her it seems like a lot of things - but then again not hundred percent one of them. So I don't even have some simple words on a paper describing my problem. She doesn't seem to care that I'd like to know. I should better call her the last one because this week I just didn't go for the first time - I saw no sense in this. And I guess even she is sick of dealing with me. Everyone just expects me to 'hold on', 'try out new things', blaaa. For them it's very easy and they can't understand why I'm not full of hope because 'you're still so young'.I'm taking two antidepressants and have already tried two before it. Meditation. Sports (I hate sports). Everything is useless. I just don't know what to do. It just hurts to be alive. I don't want to be here.",

Fuck you!She was beautiful; she was kind; she was the purest thing I’d ever seen in my life and now she’s gone. God, we only kissed. We didn’t hurt or hate. We only held hands and wanted to sleep in each others’ arms. We only needed to be happy. We only needed to live. How inhumane and ignorant do you have to be to kill her in the name of a nonexistent god? Religions are suppossed to make you better beings not savages. Apparently, that’s what you are; ruthless, clueless savages. May your heavens be filled with ever raging fires of malbolge. Fuck gods and fuck you ignorant bipeds for following them.I remember us laughing about this happening. It was such a silly matter to us. I said I’d give my life for hers if it ever comes to that. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. I was locked up in that cage we call a house and was too much of a pussy to save the love of my life from dying. No, not dying. Being ruthlessly murdered. I was spared because I was the daughter of the rich bastard who had power over people and she was killed because she was the daughter of a poor worker. If only my father was as powerless as hers was.I remember her telling me that no matter what happens she still believed in the goodness of people. That it’s your lack of understanding that causes fear and that you would never be stupid enough to take someone’s life for just loving another person. That girl believed in humanity so much that I want to eat all your hearts alive for what you did to her.What’s even more frustrating is the fucking police. I called them, I cried to them, I wept before them and all they did was standing there while that innocent girl was drowned. The law was deaf to the screams of a lover and blind to the lawlessness of gods and their followers. A blind law for a blind following; it’s only fitting. There isn’t much you can do about justice when the law is lawless except make your own. And that I will.Not all of you combined would make one of her. No amount of filthy violence you have to offer would compare to a grain of innocence she had. You’re scum and your gods are even worse for they are the creations of your collective minds of sin. Even when she was being taken away she told me that it’s going to be okay; that god will save us; which they clearly didn’t. Instead, they called her a demon, a monster. A monster that’d come to destroy me. Well, you’ve made a monster now.Once I’ve published this, I’d be preparing for one final ritual. For what you’ve done, and what you haven’t, you will pay the price. And I will too, for my weakness; and so will the gods whom you’re so devoted. I’m in pain, and it will end soon for I will be with her, sleeping homely in her arms.fFarewell, V.",

Things have slowly gone downhill, despite all that's happened in the past 19 days, I'd say two weeks within those 19 days were fairly unforgettable.. but I genuinely miss the circumstances in which those two (really three and a half weeks) were spent. The only person I have really any true feelings for is quite hard to get through. Despite what I (vaguely) know, I don't even know how they truly feel about me. Part of me says \"why bother?\", but I know I can't. Regardless.. the past four/five days have been almost a blur. I've gone out for walks everyday for five, six hours at a time.. I still feel manage to feel worse. I keep coming to the same conclusion, I'm not sure why I even bother waking up. There's a quote by Vladimir Lenin I read that's stuck with me. It seems very relevant, but I still.. don't know. No matter what I do or try.. what's the point? Just offing myself seems the best option.. there's very little for me to do other wise. Suicide, amongst a few important things, is the only thing on my mind.. it's very tempting at this point",

I changed my whole life for the better to be with her after I met her. I cleaned my act up, got sober, found a job I love. Now that she left me in May of this year I've been a total mess. Lost my job, relapsed hard on alcohol, have no money. I've been seeing a therapist who knows my ex personally, and she has helped me understand things but once I leave the office it doesn't help. I've been on medication now for a while, I feel like the process of getting better mentally is exactly what my ex tried to get me to do for our whole relationship. I blame myself for everything that happened, and the clearer my mind is the more I dwell on the things I could have done differently if I felt better earlier. I do have a new girlfriend but I can't stop comparing her to my ex and its making me have second thoughts constantly. I just want her back but I know that will never happen. I've been split black by her and she has a new boyfriend who I can't help but feel is way better than me. To make matters worse I'm 28 now, shes 27 and I've known her since I was 10-11 years old. We don't live in a big city and literally every street and every store I see or have to go to reminds me of her. It's impossible to get away from feeling like a huge chunk of my life is gone forever. Half of me wants to be the best person I can be, but that would only be for spite. The other half of me wants to end it all asap.",

I me few months ago a girl on a website, from a foreign country. We started to talk a lot and this until today, nearly a year. She told me she was major, in university, nothing special. Then, after many talks we started to have feelings and started a long distance relationship. She was shy and never sent many pics, but she totally looked like a young adult. Our relation became very serious, with family involved, projets about future and live together. Of course, we went to talk about sex and had sexual convos. Then, I knew that she is diagnosed bdp, sociopath, paranoid (i knew it before her lies) She lied to me about everything : age, past, experiences, studies, all. She is in fact really younger than me. Her parents thought she told me, but no, she lied to them too. This gap never bothered them, me I didn't know. When knew, I got shocked and hurted. (Her previous bf was 25, never bothered them)Problem is : her family and her father are ultra religious conservative. Since i was the first guy she talked sexually, they push me to marry her in few years. Despite the fact they know she lied to me. More, they threaten and blackmail me : If i betray her or leave her, they threaten me to go to court and law. Her brother threaten me of death. And since she is completely paranoid, she thinks I betrayed and told to her father that wanna destroy me like told before. Despite all my efforts to explain I never betrayed.I'm exhausted, I did many things for that girl, but she lied to me about all. I'm exhausted, I can't run away except suicide. I know too that her father and brother beats her with a belt.I don't know what to do, I'm exhausted and wanna die",

And I'm tired of struggling to make my life any better, only to worsen my condition. I'm tired of having every single friend I make, be it online or irl, take their distance from me because of how unstable I have become in the past year. And I'm also tired of being so fat, I'm tired of sitting home doing nothing instead of trying to lose some weight, not being able to breath properly and exhausting my stamina just by climbing stairs when coming back home. I'm tired of being miserable and not being able to do anything about it. I noticed I've lost another friend today. He just disappeared all of a sudden, and I can't blame him since I seemed to never have time for him, or other people. I was always in my world and whenever I got out of it, I could come at my friends either all eccessively enthusiastic, only to talk about something they didn't care about, notice they were not interested and then disappear again for a while as an excuse... or totally depressed/angry at smth for no reason apparently, ending up ranting for a while until they were so fed up with me that they'd stop reading my messages. I've lost my capacity of being present for the people I hold dear, and I think I'll find myself completely lonely sooner or later... I didn't have too many friends, you know.This is just one of the reasons I would like to end my life but thinking of the rest feels like a mess and I don't know how to explain myself. I'm so confused it's hard to convey my feelings into words, and I can never explain thoroughly what I'm really thinking... It will probably happen this time too, but at least I could get out that little bit about me being tired... I don't even know why I'm writing here. I guess it was just to write it to some people who wouldn't just panic reading the word \"suicide\" or the phrase \"I'm tired of living\" and start yelling at me that suicide isn't a solution, that life is beautiful and I still have many things to see and live and shit because muhh their opinion and they have to force it into others without actually listening to what a person has to tell them.The only reason I hesitate before gulping too many pills and finally going to bed forever is that I don't want to be remembered as a fat ugly antisocial nerd plus the fact that I'm worried someone will find my drawings and little \"poems\" as they often di express what I actually feel but I'm too attached to them and basically lazy to burn them all before ending my life. Thanks for reading and sorry for taking away your time just to put together too many turns of phrase and say nothing in the end. I think I feel a bit better seeing it \"black-on-white\", written and gathered together as it's so hard for me to gather all the pieces of my scattered thoughts and pull them together to actually say, or, in this case, write something. Though it always gets A BIT better... And then it gets back rolling down a hill just to end up on a pile of shit. I'm tired of that, too. This constant up and down that seems to always tend to the \"down\" side.Thanks and sorry again.",

I'm 24, graduated undergrad in May with a double major and am currently working on a paralegal certification.I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for around ten years at this point. Over the past year or two especially I've been losing the fight to agoraphobic tendencies. I can't imagine finding or holding down a job. I feel panicky just meeting up with somebody or running errands.I used to have so many close friends. People drift but.. it's been months since anyone reached out. I've exhausted myself trying to make friendships and relationships work with other people.I flipped out on my ex today. We stopped talking for a while. Recently started talking again and found out she's dating already after a variety of \"I can't be with anyone\" bullshit when we broke up. Told her I can't deal with being shoved off to the side for other people. I can't handle having such strong feelings for somebody anymore. I've never known that something so beautiful (love) could be so destructive.I can't imagine my future. I've always sort of had it in my head that one day I'll just off myself. I feel like that day is rapidly approaching much faster than I thought it would.I feel as though I'm losing/have lost everything. My dad's dying from cancer, all of my closest friends have made their own lives in new places. I tried reaching out to a ton of people tonight and couldn't get a single response.I don't really know what the point of this is.. I'm terrified of death, and of hurting my family, but I'm scared that if things continue the way they have been, those fears won't matter so much anymore.It's been a gentle downward slope for the last two years; the past 6 months in general have just been one thing after another.I don't know what to do. I'm the \"smart and funny\" guy. Or I was when I was more social. I can't keep up hiding behind a happy face. I just drove aimlessly for an hour today crying. I don't know what's wrong with me. I could be such a successful and happy person if I could just fix my mental illness issues.I'm laying in bed right now having a panic attack wishing I could rip myself out of my own skin. Just float around detached from everyone and everything; observing but not participating or feeling.Thanks for reading..Edit: just wanted to add that I've been seeing a psychiatrist for several years now and I'm working on getting back into therapy",

I remember pretty much all of my experiences there pretty vividly, however, I think something happened there that I dont remember. Let me explain, every night, or nearly every night, I wake up from a nightmare, I think its a nightmare, I never remember it. When I wake up I am terrified, my hearts racing and I feel genuine, REAL fear. I have gotten used to it but its really taking a tole on my mental state. I am constantly depressed and when I am around other people I feel anxious and scared to be around them. One night a few weeks ago, I went to the garage, grabbed a rope and a bucket and went across the street to a field with a big tree, and I hung the rope and was standing on the bucket with the rope around my neck and I feel like I woke up. I didnt feel in control the entire time I was going to kill myself. It was so strange. I sat on the ground next to the tree and listened to some music for a while. Since then my depression and suicidal thoughts are getting far far worse. Now, to keep myself looking forward to something, ANYTHING at this point I keep buying things off amazon. I know it sounds stupid but it seems to work for now anyway. I cant get to a doctor and Im not on any medications. My situation leaves me pretty isolated except to go to college and come home. I'm not looking for advice or anything. I just wanted to tell someone. I dont really have any friends so I guess this is the next best thing.",

I have a little problem with social skills... I don't know how to express my feelings into words, to communicate with the others, even just a normal conversation. I have been silent for too long that i almost forgot how to speak, even in my own mother language. I don't have any friends and i can't make new friends because i can't trust anyone and i'm really afraid... to say goodbye. I used to not be like this... To be honest, i miss my old self. I used to be a naughty, talkative, energetic kid because i want my mom attention, to be accepted and loved... and cause i also hate school. I've always felt marginalized, unwanted and inferior to my siblings... I envy them. Im not good at anything but i still want her to look at me and talk to me and hug me... We finally did, she finally looked at me and tried to understand what's inside my head. I was really happy till we found out she has cancer, stage 3. My father came back from nowhere after left us with debt,... to be with mom and help the hospital bills. Its still haunting me when she was crying in agony, begging to be dead and apologized for leaving her kids behind... Im... dying. I shut down eveything, locked myself and tried to kill myself. My father is dating someone right after my mom died. He left the house, took my little brother with him. My mind is completely blank, I dont know what to think nor say. It just empty... It was bad at that time but i got over it and stood up, working on a new goal. I went to college, multimedia art school. My father hate it and against me going to art school because he doesn't like my art. So I studied alot to get good grades to prove that he is wrong. I have had 3 jobs at once to earn more money for school and subsistence fee. I tried my best to make new friends and I met my first love in college. Things went well until shit happened... I've been betrayed by my first love, tricked by my co-workers and the clients didn't pay me. I got really sick and its keep getting worse ( I have lost more than 20kg due to sickness, stress and insomnia ). I have a fear of asking for help, but at that time i have no choice so i took all my brave to ask my family and friends for help... And they turned me down I gave up... It's awful. My scores getting worse each day no matter how hard i tried. Everything just collapsed and i can't hold on anymore. I quit my jobs, dropped out of my school, locked myself again... I have started to sleep a lot, the longest is nearly 3 days and still feel tired and always tired... End up spent nearly a year just lying in bed, doing nothing!! I tried again. I went out and find a job that fit me and tried again. I found a new hobby, and spent all the money i have saved to learn tattooing. I really think it's going to work this time, but once again i failed. Im a fool, a failure... Im useless, worthless,, I cant do anything right or think properly. People are so selfish, mean, ungraceful, judgmental and deceivable!! They are terrifying me. Im so tired, of everything. I just want to meet my mom, hug her and go to sleep with her... forever. Im tired, im good for nothing. I dont have any purpose to keep trying. Im afraid of going outside, talking to people. I have so many negative thoughts and it keep drowning me. I cant go out anymore. My art suck, no one like it!! Everyone is a liar. No matter how much i try, things will never change. I cant do anything, Im stuck... Father is going to sell my mom's house to pay the debt... I dont get along well with my siblings, family... I have tried too much, I pretend to be alright, always fake a smile so people stop asking and giving me more pressure. But now... I dont know what to do now... I dont even know what to think...",

The author has a very different style than GRRM's GoT, but the plot, the story, the characters, are well worth the HBO treatment. It would be GREAT in fact. It was very slow at first, but after while, I could not put it down. So I think to myself, \"This would be utterly fantastic for a T.V. series. Why has no one picked it up?\" Then I look online and see that it already has been made into a T.V. drama. Wtf? How come I never heard of it. And then I see that it only had one freaking season! Well, that's a bummer but perhaps the cast is good? Wow, a lot of famous actors, awesome! But then I see who they made Jack...you have got to be kidding me. Yeah his acting is brilliant but he doesn't fit Jack's super handsome image. Also they made Rufus Sewell Tom the Builder?! They had mother fucking Rufus \"Badass Villain\" Sewell and they made him Tom?! Man, I feel like HBO could have done a lot better. I'm gonna watch it but I feel like I am in for a letdown.",

I did not curse at her or anything but i wrote down how I felt and how things are perceived by me. I told her not to contact me. I spoke to a friend of mine that noticed that I was much less happy the past month while trying to make her feel better. But he pointed out it was my choice if I wanted to reconcile or not. I did and what a mistake it was.I send her an apology text. She said it was fine. She tells me we can meet up a day later. Its a different town and I go drive there. She knew I had to do something else prior but then tells me she's not up for it but I said I really need to tell her certain things. She says fine. I tell her the things (how I battled through depression for many years) but all the time she said she really wants to go back to watching the tv show she was watching (project runway) I barely talk to her for 8 minutes (it took me 25 minutes to drive there) and I say what I needed to tell her and she says we should hang out this weekend and she will text me later. So far no text.The next day I get a call from my cousin. Her mother, my aunt died. I was not close to them because there is an age gap of 15 years as well as infighting between my parents and theirs. But I am the intermediary and go to talk to my cousins. I went Wednesday night for 7 hours talking to one cousin. And I went today talking to the other cousin. But today was emotionally draining. My uncle is telling me everything wrong with my father and what he did while I just sat there nodding occasionally while allowing him to talk about him and my father. There are times I wanted to call out his shit but his wife of 50 years just died and I can't. So I sit there for at least 4 hours of belittlement while I am pretty sure my relationship to the friend prior is over over.....I want to cry but I cannot. I am so numb though, its somewhat like when my brother died. Actually my older cousins asked for advice from me because they knew I went through it. It is very weird telling your mid 40's cousins how to prepare for a funeral that you are well antiquated with. What to do, what to buy, which casket to buy, burial plot, etc.I am just stretched so thin. I am somewhat certain that if I asked the friend to come she would but the way she is acting I do not want to bring a \"friend\" to my family's funeral. I do not think I ever want to talk to her because clearly project runway is more important that silly me needing me to tell her my problems. It seems to me that she is a taker and will not give back anything. On top of the monetary things she said she would pay me back or. Or the other things.The saving grace this week that is making me look forward, I also got a phone call from the blood donation company that I matched perfectly with a infant that needs my white blood cells. Apparently its a 1 in a million shot that we matched. I am doing it Tuesday since that is the legal timeline I can give since I donated this past Monday and am ineligible to donate for 7 days. This is literally the only light at the end of the tunnel. I need to stay alive so a kid can survive using my body that I can care less for. I am so tired. I am feeling so depressed. tired.",

What (iyo) are the best novels ever written by a person who was: A) below age 20; B) above age 80; C) above age 90? From what I've seen, it seems like the vast majority of the authors that end up going down in history as all-time greats, tended to start to get really good at writing by somewhere around their mid to late 20's, but not usually write their first full fledged \"masterpiece\" until they were in their 30's or 40's, hitting their prime somewhere in that age range, or occasionally a little later, and some occasional late bloomers (or late culminators) who didn't create their magnum opus until they were well into their 50's or 60's, or occasionally even 70's.But, I am curious about some significant exceptions to the statistical norm in this regard.So, what, in your opinion, is the best novel ever written by someone less than 20 years old, and also, what are the best novels ever written by an author who was above 80 years old, and by an author who was above 90 years old.(And, of course it goes without saying, if the author wrote a book when they were in their 30's or something, but didn't publish it until they were in their 80's or 90's or it was published posthumously upon their death or something like that, that does count for the purposes of this thread. It needs to be that they were roughly that old at the time they actually wrote it.)",

      "text": "I'm sobbing uncontrollably while I write this, attempted to kill myself Sunday night, obviously didn't work. I've been held captive by my suicidal depression since I was 12, I'm 21 now, nearly half my life and the longer this stays with me the less and less I remember life before this disease. I need companionship, female companionship. I have about 3, maybe 4 friends if you really stretch it, none of them women, even though they are the best people I know and they've helped me out through this as best as anyone can be expected to when they hear a close friend wants to kill themselves (I hate making my problems everyone else's.) I need a real relationship, a tender, intimate love to save me from what I've attempted 2-3 times (nothing makes me feel lower than fucking up a suicide attempt,) but I'm so terrified of rejection because I feel like if I keep getting shot down I'll be known as that loser who can't make it with anyone. I don't really have anything in common with anyone my age, I'm a guitarist (who can hardly play the scales or stay in rhythm after playing for 4 years and taking lessons with teachers who've had decades of experience all along the way) who loves 60s-70s psychedelic and blues and jazz music and I fucking loathe today's pussy \"rock\" music and shitty rap that everyone I know adores. I guess you can say I march to the beat of my own drum, but when everyone else in the proverbial drum line is drumming another way and the crowd notices the one rogue drummer, I can't help but feel embarrassed for sticking out like such a weirdo. And because of this I feel like an alien who doesn't belong with the rest of humanity. I could never tell my folks about this because it'd break their hearts, and I just can't see that happen. I'm trapped in a purgatory between wanting to kill myself and feeling selfish knowing I'll leave a void and break my mom and dad's hearts, not wanting anyone to know what's wrong with me and expecting everyone to read my mind and just get it from looking at me. All this is making college impossible, and I'm hesitant to see the school's therapist because I had a friend who went to Northwestern that did the same thing when benzos and coke and alcohol were making him suicidal and the therapist got the cops involved and stuck him in an in-patient facility, called his parents (who had to make the haul from Indiana to Chicago) and he had to drop out. NOT happening, NOT an option, but I need professional help that my parents will have no idea of my seeing.",

      "text": "I decided today I finally want to die Today I finally decided that I need to kill myself. It’s not something that I haven’t thought about hundreds of times over the past few years. It’s not even like anything significant has happened recently to push me to this decision. In fact, over the past month things have been pretty good. I was really low a few months back. I lost my dad after a long battle with prostate cancer and a few weeks after I had a miscarriage. I could barely leave the house or interact with anyone for some time. This month I started back at uni and actually started talking to some people on my course and became ‘editor’ of a group, something I would never have done this time last year. I’ve been getting up every day and going to work/uni, started making more of an effort with my appearance and moved into a new flat. Overall, things are better than they have been and I’ve been feeling better. But I still just feel this constant void in my life. Everyone else has friends. I have work friends, maybe even uni friends but no one who I can say I share a genuine, human connection with. There is no one for me to call at night when I can’t sleep. Everyone else is always on nights out, going on holidays with mates, sleepovers, shopping trips. I don’t have the type of friendship with anyone where I can just do normal things. And I try so hard to try and get close to people but it’s like no one ever chooses to have me around. I don’t get invited to anything so maybe I’m just boring to be around. Friends that I’ve had for a while try to keep in touch, especially since losing my dad but it just seems false and unnatural. Everyone always says “we should catch up some time” but “some time” never comes around. All I want is to feel some genuine companionship from someone. I go to uni, I go to work, I come home and get high by myself and then I fall asleep. My entire existence just feels like a waste of time. I don’t even see the point of going to uni and getting a degree or job, what’s the point of making money if I have no one to spend it with? I have no one to make plans with. I'm 21 and I spend every night alone. My life is empty and I feel worthless. There must be something wrong with me that stops me from forming connections with people. There must be something wrong with me. I try my best to be a good person but nothing good ever comes of it. I just hate everything right now and I don’t want to breathe anymore. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow and be miserable again but I know that I have to. Suicide isn’t something you can or should do on impulse so I’m making a plan. My first step is writing this out, I guess you could call this a summary of my death. I’m sure there will be other things I need to write, letters to my mum and boyfriend at least. Maybe even an explanation for my flat mate and work colleagues. I don’t want anyone to feel like this is their fault because it’s not. Maybe this life just wasn’t meant for me because all I seem to experience is pain and loneliness. I want to die before I lose my mind and before I end up on hard drugs or in a mental hospital. I’ve been thinking a lot about who will find me, and hoping it won’t be anyone I know. I’m not scared that it will hurt but I’m scared that it won’t work and I’ll have to tell everyone what I was thinking. I know that this must sound crazy and maybe I am. But who will miss me when I’m alone all the time anyway? Who will miss talking to me when no one talks to me now? I know people will cry and say rest in peace but after a month or two, maybe less, they’ll forget about me. I’m nobody to anybody.",

      "text": "Creepy orthodontist This happened yesterday, and I'm still a little creeped out. So, I've had crooked teeth my whole life, and I really hadn't minded that much. We couldn't afford braces, so I haven't been to an orthodontist at all. Well, recently, my insurance let us know that if I needed braces, they would pay for most of the cost. (It's state insurance, so we were surprised.) My mom jumped at the offer, saying that I should straighten my teeth while I have the chance, before I'm a legal adult. So, this was my first trip to the orthodontist. I think I should preface by saying that this office was tiny, and looked like an old trailer attached to the side of a larger building. We checked in, were lead to a room, everything seemed pretty normal. Well, before he even comes into the room, I hear the orthodontist ask his assistant, \"What about tonight? Do you want to go to dinner tonight?\"Sounding annoyed, she replied, \"No. Someone is picking me up after work.\" It sounded like this has happened before. When he came into the room, the first thing he said was, \"What's a cute kid like you doing in a place like this?\" Oookay. My mom glanced at me for a minute before talking to the doctor. He's just straight up staring at me while she talks to him until he crosses the room to look at pictures of my teeth. He says, \"You have beautiful, beautiful teeth.\" I took it as a compliment the first five times he said it. Until he added, \"Man, I wish those were in my mouth.\"The commentary after this was equally as weird. He kept saying things like, \"You're already beautiful, why do you need straight teeth?\" And, \"We can't make your teeth straight. You'd have to beat off the boys with a stick.\" Exact words. Keep in mind that this man is 70+, and I'm 16. I look young for my age. This comment was the one that really kinda topped everything off. He put his gloves on, and these were his exact words, \"Okay, I'm gonna slide my fingers in your mouth now. I know they taste good, and you can lick, but you can't bite.\" Then he giggled.What the fuck?It didn't really get creepier than that (but I don't really know how it could.)He talked to my mom for a few minutes about my dentist, said I had beautiful teeth a few more times, and finally left. I don't know if I'm overreacting or misinterpreting, but this really freaked me out. My mom wants me to see another orthodontist, but we can't because of our insurance. If I can figure out a way to see a new one, creepy orthodontist guy, let's not meet again.",

I can't stop thinking about just packing up my stuff and going. The reason I don't is 1) we have 2 kids and 2) I have nowhere to go. I think maybe I should just leave them behind too, but I just cannot do that. They are the I my reasons keeping me from wanting to die. Without them my life has no meaning so I may as well just die if I'm going to leave them behind. I just don't want to keep on breathing through this pain anymore. I feel so worthless. So invisible.

      "text": "dark memories never fade I feel like im at the end of the road this last week, I have a lot of secrets I haven't told anyone and I have a really dark secret I've told two people. I'll start off by saying that I told my best friend and brother (at separate times) that I was raped by one of my brothers friends when I was 6 and he was 13. My best friends response was kind of just that I should tell my brother and that I dont need therapy because I seem okay, my brothers response was that I just shouldnt let this define me as a person and he kept asking me questions that made me feel like he thought I was lying about it and he also told me to get therapy. The other thing traumatic that happened was me being on a hardcore meth binge in 2012, I was only 16 at the time and I cant even remember the first time I did it, I remember staying up for 80 hours at a time and crawling on the ground with flashlights looking for leftover crystals to smoke and stealing from my neighbors and friends to fuel this addiction, I'm thankful that I was able to stop after a month or so but the way it stopped wasn't exactly pleasant. The main person I used to tweak out with was a friend and after a month of hardcore meth binging he wanted to move in with me and my parents and start selling it out of my house, I told him we cant do that because I dont want my family involved and that same weekend he came to my house with a strange dude and a gun and asked me \"Are your parents awake?\" I told him they weren't and he asked \"Do they have a gun?\" I responded that they do have a gun and his final response before SPRINTING out of my room at full speed and ransacking my house was \"Well they better not wake up because if they do; I'll kill them\" They didn't kill my parents and they were later arrested and served 3 months (thanks california) Other reasons that have pushed me to this point are the fact that my parents 100% did not want me to be born, my brother is 30, my sister is 33 and I am 22, they were supposed to be done having kids before my mother got pregnant with me. That basically meant that I received little to no attention from my parents, my father worked a night shift and slept all day so I've never really had a conversation with him nor can I because he speaks primarily spanish and can hardly speak english and I never learned spanish because I was never around him. Both my parents are good people but they got themselves in a ton of debt in between my siblings being born and me being born, this meant that they withdrew all their retirement funds to put my sister through college and bought her a car, she totaled that car and they bought her a new one, she also totaled that one and they helped her buy another one. They bought my brother two cars and helped co sign his last car he bought 6 years ago, the only time my parents have offered to help me was when they tried getting me to help buy THEM a car in their names and they would let me drive it, I don't live with them anymore but I still have to send them money monthly to help them with expenses since they are very old and my father is retired and my mom got fired from her job that paid well in 2014 and she settled for a job she is 200% over qualified for, she has a masters degree in business management and gets paid 14 dollars and hour and every time I tell her shes better than that she just shrugs me off and tells me thats the job she wants to retire from, I dont have any resent towards my parents, I have resent towards myself for even being born in the first place, everytime i look in the mirror I see a disgusting human being who deserves the worst in life, when I take my clothes off it is amplified by my disgusting body hair that has been the main subject for many people being grossed out or insulting me. I am so fucking tired of everything and two days ago I basically just ragequit my whole friend circle because they keep fucking ditching me, i told them it bothers me when they ditch me and they basically just laughed it off. What is the point of continuing? I'm 22 and I'm a grunt at my job, I hardly graduated high school so theres basically no chance of me getting into college and my teeth are completely FUCKED, i have to spent two thousand dollars I dont have on getting root canals, the pain is nothing compared to what i feel inside, i cant type anymore because im crying at this point",

And even though this is the cheaply woven fabric of my life, even though I am the hand that knocks unwelcome and uninvited on doors of empty houses, the cultivator of insufferable misery on hot endless nights of paranoia. Ceaselessly unendurable and obsessive repetition. A life nailed to the ground by dulled cowardice and uninventive thought.In spite of all of that, there was a time when I… When I thought something more than all of this was in my grasp. There was a time when I could feel the ground underneath my feet and I walked forward into time instead of standing still, stranded in the semi darkness with skewed memories of the past to keep me.

      "text": "Just waiting for payday In secondary school (UK), I used to be friends with everyone in my year and always had people to talk to. But now I'm in 2nd year university and am 20, and for the last 3 years I haven't had any real friends. People I work with or hang out with purely because I have to. No one close, no one who genuinely cares about me.On top of this, my family are devout Asian Muslims, and are super traditional whereas I gave up religion since I was 14, but have pretended to still believe in it still, because they're not very understanding and would honestly just exile me if they found out. This whole pretending thing means I can't be in a relationship unless I hide it - which I tried and ended badly-, I can't go out drinking and generally have no social life because of it. I also have to commute to university 3 days a week, which takes 2.5 hours each way, getting up at 6am and getting home around 9pm. It leaves me very stressed, constantly sleepy and unable to focus. I'm over a month into the acedemic year and I haven't managed to write a single thing.But all of this is how I've been living for the last 3 years, and for that time I simply managed to cope with it, just about. Because I didn't know what I was missing. However this summer, I went volunteering in Nepal for 2 months and had the happiest time of my life. I was in a beautiful country, had so many friends who I was constantly having fun with and going out drinking, I had a relationship with a girl which ended up very deep and emotional in just those 2 months. In other words, for those 2 months I got to experience everything I've ever wanted and what everyone else generally already can do. But because of my culture and family, I can't and will never be able to properly experience these things again.I got back 2 months ago now and I still can't stop thinking about it as I now know what I've been missing my whole life and to be able to have it for such a short time and then be dragged back into my lonely life at home is killing me. I've cried myself to sleep almost ever night and I keep thinking about my future. I can't keep pretending to live a life I hate but I know my parents and whole family will just treat me like shit if I tell them I don't want to be Muslim. I already have no friends and I'll end up losing my family too. This feeling of emptiness is crushing me and I'm just waiting for payday so I can order about 30mg of Xanax, about 40x10mg Diazepam tablets, take a few sleeping pills and drink it all with a bottle of whiskey. I'm going to sell all my expensive stuff like Supreme clothes etc and donate all the money. It worked out to be a minimum of £2000. At least I can leave something good.I don't fear death, I've always been curious in a sense. But I would rather live and be able to change my circumstances, but who doesn't want that I guess... I don't know the point of this post but I just needed to tell someone, anyone really. I'll try to write up a Will soon.",

I've been really struggling with my mental health especially since I graduated high school in June of 2016. I feel like I have no purpose no matter what I end up doing. When you're depressed this long, your interests and ambitions have long disappeared along with your happiness, which fucking sucks. My life is going absolutely nowhere in a job or education sense. I've been seeing a man for a few months now, we'd been friends for over two years before this. I love him more than anything but it's so draining because I feel like I'm only existing for him. His life is progressing beautifully and I feel like I'm holding him down. I've fucked up a lot of people's minds in the past when it comes to my suicidal tendencies and I absolutely cannot hurt him like that. It's driving me mad that I have to deal with these emotions day in and day out. I feel like I'm wasting his time, and I just want him to be happy. Even if I ended up staying alive I don't think I could fulfill the happiness he deserves. He's the most beautiful and compassionate person I've met in my life and the last thing I want to do is traumatize him. I hate being stuck. I wish I could just get in a fatal car accident so no one would feel like they were to blame. Or maybe I'm just delaying the inevitable. Maybe I should just take the plunge.

Their work ethic is absolutely insane, and they are so musically gifted. These albums have been keeping me going and delaying my suicide, and I'm ashamed to say that I'm only alive for Brockhampton. I don't want to kill myself until I've heard the completed trilogy in its entirety. Once Saturation III drops, I will likely end my life.",

I feel like my mom took care of me and my sister really well (sister is is going to NYU) but I feel like I have dissapointed her I always gave her trouble ever since elementary school I dropped out of private school from bad grades in 6th grade so I moved to a public school made a lot of friends I mainly hanged out with the nerdy type kids but even there I felt left out at times I felt like they never did like me in their group (This is where I started developing social anxiety) after maybe 4 months I stopped going to middle school completely and I somehow got into high school (I guess it just wasn't worth the hassle to keep me there) I never did go to high school maybe for 3 months and at that point I felt like I was finally overcoming my social anxiety and depression but then as I was walking back home from school I got mugged by a couple of big kids (they were seniors I was a freshman) at that point I just couldn't take it anymore I thought to myself after all this time of feeling like complete garbage and finally overcoming it the world throws me a big \"fuck you\" so I stopped going to school for maybe 2 years after giving my mom so much trouble I guess she thought I needed more \"extreme measures\" (I knew she was doing it because she cared about me but I fought over the idea) so I was sent to a therapeutic foster home the first home I went to I went to school everyday (even got myself on the honor roll somehow) but then I got into a fight with another foster kid living there so I was moved to a second home and over there I feel i've felt my worst the parents there did not like me at all they would talk behind my back and even in front of me of how \"bad\" of a kid I am and I just couldn't take it anymore there were countless times where I told the people that overlooks the foster home of how shit I feel there but I couldn't leave... So I did the only thing I could do and that was running away I ran smoked some marijuana I bummed off of a homeless man and slept in a bathroom (that's how badly I wanted to stay away from the foster home) the next day I got a call and got locked in a psychiatric ward where I met people I guess I would consider \"friends\" and I was happier but being locked in a psychiatric ward for a few months just made me want to be outside I even met a girl in there that I got along with and liked (we had alot of the same problems) got into a sort of relationship I guess with her (I know bad idea) but my second to last day there she just told me she liked someone else in there I was pretty hurt and I didn't even thing about it and just started cutting my wrists the next day I was discharged but I hid the scars so I could get out and now (2017) I've been feeling a lot better about myself just got a job and less anxiety when talking to people but for some reason I still feel SO lonely, coming home I guess is the hardest part...No friends or family to talk to, No one to hear my stupid jokes, no one to even hear how lonely I am...",

I was stuck in bed, feeling more depressed with my constant head cold like symptoms, feeling lethargic, sad and desperate. My anxiety was becoming horrendous, I was developing OCD because of the fear of touching/smelling/inhaling everything in case that was why I was having these symptoms. My doctor told me I could be like it for life and I may never get better. We finally found an ENT who took me seriously 18 months later. He scanned my sinuses and ears and said they are perfectly clear and diagnosed a jaw issue. Finally, I had a reasoning, a medical reason for feeling like I did. TMJ. I matched every symptom perfectly and there was hope. We found a dentist who specialised and he ordered a scan which showed significant damage to the TM joints and degeneration. A heavy programme of physio, rehabilitation, splint therapy and soft food followed as I finally got out of my lower, hopeless moods and anxieties and found a path to normality. The pain got worse and worse as I underwent treatment, and I went on painkillers daily. I was miserable, but hopeful. He retired last Christmas and I saw a colleague who referred me to the surgeon they use. He said the issue hadn't resolved at all non invasively and now it was time for surgery. I'm in the UK and the waiting lists over here for the NHS are exterminate, so we had to self fund. Lying in bed the night before, I knew I would either get my life back, or it would fail and I would feel worse than ever. The operation came, went and 4 months later I've not seen any improvement, and have now developed severe anxiety and PTSD symptoms after collapsing 2 days after the surgery. The nurses put it down to taking off the bandages and the heavy cocktail of drugs I was on, but it was terrifying. My head felt pressured, things felt surreal and it shook me. I now keep having panic attacks ever since. My anxiety daily is 100/100. I'm severely depressed, in pain, things feel surreal and I'm forgetful. I'm seeing a therapist who is trying to help me manage my pain and, although she is so lovely and helpful, it just is so tough talking about it. I'm empty, broken, hopeless and sad. I'm waiting for the next anxiety attack, living through the days terrified of my anxiety, avoiding everything because I'm now not 100% sure what is causing the symptoms, and waiting to go back to sleep. Things are a blur, and my therapist said I am severely anxious and depressed and struggling to find positivity as well as having flashbacks. Nothing is getting better and I don't know what to do anymore. Thank you to whoever reads this.",

      "text": "Car Dealership has literally lost my car. Short version:So, as the title says…. The dealership has literally lost my wife’s car.Long version:Like many in Texas, we had some flood damage to my wife’s car (2013 Civic) due to Harvey. After being stranded in various cities for five days, we managed to get to the car (the airport is over an hour from our house.)Preliminary inspection had mold on the seats, everything on the floor completely soaked, and it smelled to high heaven. Electronics from the fob weren’t working. Classic flood loss. Inconvenient, but no big deal. We leave the information on the dash, get her belongings, and file our claim. Just waiting for confirmation of loss to go and get her new car.Fast forward a few days, and our adjuster estimates the damage at $1200 based off a visual exterior examination (she didn’t have the keys.) Laughable to anyone with experience with floods, but an easy enough fix. Call them to arrange tow to a dealership to get an actual inspection and move this process along. Car gets to the dealer shortly before 5pm on Thursday, we drop the keys off around 6. This is where it starts to get interesting.We get a call on Friday saying they can’t find our car. They had the details of my previous car, so were looking for the wrong one. Easy enough, make model color license, here you go. Another few days pass, they still can’t find it. My wife leaves work early yesterday, says I’ll walk the lot with you. She walks the lot with the advisor. Nothing. Advisor has walked the lot 6 times, sent 2 porters and a service director. Nothing.We call the insurance company, because obviously there was a mistake with the tow. After some back and forth with the insurance rep (calling the dealer to confirm, so on and so forth) we get the actual tow truck driver on the phone. He confirms exactly when and where he dropped it off. Every detail we could ask for, including he dropped it off WITH OUR SERVICE ADVISOR. Ok, now something is off. Service director gets involved, apologizing profusely, and is just as confused as we are. She suggests that possibly another tow truck grabbed it, thinking it was a loss, because it was a common color and trim for the vehicle, particularly after something like Harvey. Plausible, though absurd.So we get everyone on a conference call, and the insurance suggests checking any video footage, which everyone agrees is probably the reasonable option. However the dealer has all their footage offsite, so it’s going to be tomorrow (well, today) before they’ll have anything. Insurance says if it’s not checked, they’re going to file the car as stolen. So we file that. … and that’s where we’re at. We had a car towed to a dealer to confirm flood damage and move on with our lives, and the car has disappeared from the lot.No one I’ve talked to has seen a situation like this, so like a proper modern adult, I’m presenting the information to Reddit to see if anyone has anything.All the best.",

      "text": "\"Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA\" -Book review in Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists. About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions & Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming \"Defense\" industry \"Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA\"; By Anne Hessing CahnBook review in the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" January, 1999No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly Soviet military expenditures. In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by \"projecting a sense of complacency.\" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by \"independent\" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the \"intellectual godfather\" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the \"intensity, scope, and implicit threat\" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that \"Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded.\" It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided \"intellectual fodder\" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that \"the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup.\" The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, \"has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow.\" Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.\"Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA\" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.Paul C.

I've since told 2 close friends, who are supportive, but I'm sure they're getting tired of being bothered by me. One asked if I still felt suicidal thoughts and the other made me promise to not try again. Both times I panicked and said whatever I could so they wouldn't get worried call the cops or some shit (were in different states). My first thought once I came to (after it took a minute to realize who/where I was and what just happened) was disappointment it didn't work. For a few days, I still felt depressed but interested in trying to stay alive, but that feeling honestly went away pretty quickly. Now all I can think about is doing it again but this time I know what I did wrong and how to do it right, as well as what it'll feel like until I'm unconscious and unfeeling. I don't know what to do. The only two people who I trust with this I have already lied to, and if I go I'm going to leave a note specifically apologizing to them for that. I visited my family this weekend, which was way too soon and upsetting, considering less than a week ago I accepted that I'd never be seeing them or my hometown again, but I can't tell my parents, this would hurt them too much. I'm scared of going to a hospital or therapy because I'm in uni and, oddly enough, one of the only things I still give a fuck about are my classes, so I don't know what to do, how to feel. I can't stop thinking and wishing about what if it had worked. As a side note, today was made no better by going to my sister's bday, who I hadn't seen since this summer when she told me I should've hung myself. The whole time I just wanted to show my her the belt I was wearing, the belt I tried to kill myself with. I wanted to show her the tears in the leather from what I did. I wanted to show her that I tried to give her what she wanted for her birthday. Not trying to die just to spite my sister but it sickens me that she could say that to her own family, when she has fucking scars all up and down her arms from cutting as a kid. Sorry if this is nothing but ranting, I've been trying to process this all week. Thanks for reading. Tl;Dr: tried to kill myself last week and suicidal thoughts are back already",

I stopped enjoying a lot of thinks I liked: I dropped kendo and I almost stopped reading and cooking. And today, I lost interest in the last thing that gave me a little bit of hope: today I sat for about an hour in the front of my laptop, watching the half-writted page about my new Dungeons & Dragons homemade setting without being able to write a single word, with a persistent voice in my mind repeat the phrase that always preceded me dropping an activity. \"It's just a loss of time, just a burden. Nothing good will ever come out from it.\" So, here we are. Today, for the first time, I tried cutting myself. It was painful and great at the same time, feeling my chest burning at every breath because of the cuts made me feel alive. I finally reached the bottom of my personal barrel, I gave up on hoping I'll feel better one day and I accepted the self-destructive path that will lead me to die trying to replace my hollowness with pain. I think this is only way for me to die with a smile on my face.",

My fiance is on here all the time so I figured I'd give it a shot to talk to someone, anyone. I'm 18, just turned 18 this year and at 17 my mom pushed me to go to cosmetology school.. I had graduated early and she wanted me to get my life started Blah Blah. I was depressed already, but agreed and here starts my shit journey with this school and everyone in it. It's the cheapest cosmetology school that was near me at the time(I live an hour and some change away now. But still have to go woohoo!) The teachers are a JOKE.. I am free labor I'm not taught anything I'm supposed to be I know I'm gonna fail my state board test because of this and I only have a few months left.. Anyways! This isn't just about the school I just. I'm venting because I have nothing else to talk about in a way idk what to say ughhh. Sorry, So as a kid I was depressed always from the age of 5 my uncle's pal molested/raped me until I was like.. 13(?) Maybe longer, honestly everything blurred together now.. he threatened my younger sister if I ever told anyone and threatened to hurt my mom etc.etc. in school i never had any friends ever, might sound like \"pff well everyone has at least one friend\" no, I had none.. ever if I ever started to get a friend I got really clingy and overly attached and they'd eventually abandon me or start bullying me like everyone else. People at school would cut me burn me rip out hair /cut hair step on my feet. In gym class I had to do wall pushups in this awful little ledge thing and I had the senior T.A kick my feet off the wall and the rest of the class laughed.. in p.e another time we had to do a run called the cross country run. You literally had to run up a huge mountain that was connected to a large main road and through a dry riverbank. Etc, well a man who at the time i assumed was an older student (he had a school jacket on) assaulted me. I realize now he was just a random man that probably watched the school and learned our days for this track. I hid this from everyone and got severely depressed started selfharming and trying to drown myself. My parents found this out YEARS later and forced me to go to a shrink and the police. I had to go through private exams and i felt extremely violated. Later resulting in having a HUGE Panic attack and my dad threatening to punch me in the face. Then me getting put into a hospital overnight and treated like a test subject by my family. School got worse, I failed everything and eventually my mom put me in a new school. This new school wasn't a normal school it was a homeschool with on campus classes.. Anyway I met a guy who was 5 years older than me and we eventually dated. I wouldn't have sex with him, SOO! He drugged me at a party took advantage of me with his cousin and video taped IT WOOHOO! This became blackmail. I dated him a little over a year after that my mom eventually ripped me out of school as she saw I was getting more and more depressed (my mom is no saint in all this. She was verbally and mentally abusive to me and just me. Same with my dad. And my little sister was the Angel in the family.) And I started failing yet again. Zach (fake name of my now ex boyfriend) got pissed at this and spread the video more than he ever had before. It was all over everything. My parents took everything away. Phone, computer, tv, outside, my music my d's. Everything I was so depressed I didn't eat anything for months. . I finished all my school stuff asap after all this. Was done around 15/16. Then Met my now fiance who is the best, he is perfect. I'm moved out of my house now and with him and life is better right? Wrong, everything hurts I'm constantly feeling self conscious about EVSRYTHING. It doesn't help that he is REALLY bad with his computer. He is on it 24/7 for his school and his work and his games or his videos or his Reddit or this or that. He looks at his computer more than he looks at me. In the beginning of our relationship he ignored me constantly for this stupid fucking game. And I almost killed myself so many times during that time period. I know I'm babbling and I'm sure none of this makes sense but I'm constantly fuxking sad. I love him I love my life now I have a bunch of animals 11... now.. lol! I have loving grandparents.. I'm getting married! But I'm sad, life has caught up to me. My school is making me miserable. My past is hurting my present and my future and I feel like I'm slowly slipping. Well.. quickly slipping I guess.. I still don't have friends, I don't drive don't have a job. We live off a very fixed income. I don't have tampons when I need em (not his fault.. but I know they cost quite a bit. So I never ask.) I am living, eating, breathing..getting what I need. I am in a happy enviroment i laugh and i have a loving soon to be husband and some loving family. But I'm so sad.. I'm sorry guys idk if anyone will evsn read or answer this.. how do you answer this?? I'm just sad.. ive attempted suicide a handful of times. Ive drank windex and taken pills my mom had. Ive tried hanging myself drowning. Etc. Im exhausted. I just want to be better.I'm sorry for all the rambling.. I'm a crying bubbling mess I'm so sad.I hope the rest of you guys are doing well.. thanks for reading or skimming through this heap of garbage.Sorry for any typos or errors.",

I don't know how much of it was psychological trauma and how much was the concussion I sustained from being very badly beaten, but my memory of everything around that time is spotty. I forgot about/repressed it or whatever for several years. Something unrelated one day made me remember everything, it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like I was reliving it all and felt like I was having a never-ending panic attack for about 4 days. This buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol/pornography/cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant ways.I'm afraid to talk about what happened to anyone, even people I trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again or worse. I have ZERO desire to get any kind of justice or anything, I just want to move on with my life, but I feel like I just can't. I've tried self-help techniques and meditation but I still think about it every day and sometimes I'm just completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and can't escape them.I have been an unemployed shut-in living with my parents for several years. I'm afraid to go outside and can only force myself to do so if it's to buy drugs/alcohol. I'm so tired of living this way I don't know what to do. I tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and when I told him that I felt like he didn't really seem to be caring or paying attention to what I was saying he literally told me to my face he was just there to get his hours. I was devastated and gave up on the idea of therapy.I don't know what to do. I don't want to give up but it seems like it would be so easy. I am not dumb or crazy and am willing to at least listen to any advice people have to offer. Thank you for reading this.",

      "text": "Getting Over Jesse Franklin. Book review. Getting over Jesse Franklin – Stephie Chapman.The blurb:What happens when you find your 90’s boyband crush on Facebook, and then add him as a friend?Back in the nineties Cassie loved Jesse. But he was the bass player in her favourite band and didn’t even know she existed. Fourteen years on, the band has broken up and she’s found him on Facebook, and it turns out that after finally meeting in London, he quite likes her, too. Things between them quickly intensify and Cassie and Jesse soon find themselves in a long distance relationship spanning five thousand miles.Just as Cassie is beginning to think all her dreams have come true, she’s reminded that when something seems too good to be true, it usually is. But whilst she tries to piece her life back together in London, over in LA, Jesse is planning a way to win her back. I am always a bit wary about reading anything written by someone I follow, and chat to, on twitter. What if I don’t enjoy it?Totes awkward. Especially if I’ve told them I’m reading it. I worry that I’d have to leave twitter in case they ask me if I liked their book.So, I’d been putting off reading Getting Over Jesse Franklin. But it’s on offer, free on Amazon right now, and when I saw that, I suddenly had a bad case of FOMO.I had to read it because what if I was missing out on a good thing?And I’m so glad that I did!Just one chapter in I tweeted that I was hooked.I walked around Asda, still reading, this evening, and I’m admitting nothing here but I might have served pot noodles for dinner because I could not put the book down.If you’ve ever had a crush on a member of a band you’ll enjoy the trip down memory lane, if you’re a sucker for a romance you’ll love this one.It’s not insta love, which so many stories are lately, it’s a romance that blossoms, at first, on the internet.We’ve all been there haven’t we? Waiting, hoping, for a message to ping, almost afraid to look in case it doesn’t, feeling your heart stop for a moment when it does.Let me tell you, I now have a major crush on Jesse Franklin!Stephie writes so well, the story keeps moving, I loved the cast of characters, Cassie’s friends, family, colleagues, and of course Jessie’s family.The story is told by Cassie and reads in such a way that it’s like a friend telling you a story over a bottle of wine and a slice – or two – of cake.The descriptive writing is spot on, I could picture every scene perfectly.At one point I wanted to grab Cassie by the shoulders, give her a firm shake and tell her not to do it, to slow down, but she did do it, and she broke my heart. There I was reminiscing about the posters I had on my wall as a teen, smiling because sometimes an online relationship can lead to love, my optimistic heart all a flutter, then boom! I found myself heartbroken in aisle 7 of my local Asda.I absolutely loved this book! So much that I’m now going to buy the sequel, Jetplanes to Jupiter. I just hope I can put it down for long enough to cook a proper dinner tomorrow.I wholeheartedly recommend Getting Over Jesse Franklin but read it at the weekend because you’ll get nothing done.5/5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

      "text": "I deserve death b/c I may have indirectly affected a pregnant lady and unborn child I am a 22 year old loser and a piece of shit who has suffered a lot of traumas and disappointments throughout his long and painful life. I am lonely friendless and received countless humiliations in elementary when I was publicly hit and traumatized from the vice-principal for being outside of my seat, I was a working class kid with a single mother behind tuition for a few months in a private school near my house ( Private school in South America) and high school( public school, suburbs, USA). Middle school is where I actually fought to stay alive and stood my ground against street kids when I lived near Washington DC( Inner city school). I was the target of the senior prank in High School for having committed mistakes( pretend someone I am really not but it was about only myself) but not that bad but just appeared as a weak target and the prank was so bad that actually the school removed prom for a while and most seniors were pissed off at me for being the main reason prom was being questioned LOL. Had I not had the life and death experience from middle school , I would have definitely either dropped out or committed suicide . I went to graduation even though nobody clapped for me. I am a virgin due to being small, skinny and short with gynecomastia aside from being socially awkward and being almost cursed when it comes to relationships since it gets ruined at some point. I am from a 3rd world country(South America). I was too much of a piece of shit that I was too depressed when I turned 21 ( community college student) and forgot to petition my mom from my country until I was 22 and 2 months. I could not get a job until 21 and 3 months. I was resented with life overall including my emotionally abusive and neglectful dad and my mom that was a single mother that did not prepare me for the harsh episodes that I would face in life. (coward, sheltered and awkward)I visited my country in July 2017 and find that my mom has cancer in mid August 2017( after surgery and examination while hospitalized). I petitioned her green card since I have dual citizenship in April 2017 to come live with me in the States and not be as lonely without any children since she has not been with me or my sister since 22 years because I was the only one able to travel for many reasons. One of those days where I was riding a public bus ( kinda like the metro bus but its from private businesses) at night. I was feeling so frustrated and resentful overall with my life . I was going back from the hospital to my residence in my country( Mom was recovering from surgery when they said the tumour was cancerous in her uterus and was spread to the bone) . The bus driver stopped at a mall at late rush hour where a lot of people boarded the bus. One of them was a pregnant lady with her friend (girl) . The lady could not have any less than 7 months of pregnancy since her belly was significally pretty big. I would say 7 and a half months pregnant maximum. There was a young girl that gave her seat to the lady ( I was sitting next to the window) . Since the driver was slowly advancing for about 10 minutes( no exageration) and we were taking a long time ( to almost fully load the bus) . I was wearing a hat at that time and yelled angrily \" Yo, dude, you already half an hour in here , lets go \". In a very angrily and menacing way. Almost imitating a street thug( a wannabe street thug) . I certainly don't have a menacing presence, but I do have a deep voice for my small and skinny frame plus I was wearing a hat and presented myself a little bit \"street- oriented\" so any potential criminals would at least think about it when I got off from the bus since it was like at 9 pm almost and I live in the capital of my country and we have a lot robberies and assaults especially in cities all throughout South America. I did not know what the fuck was going thru my head at the time but I am confessing that It was definitely not a good experience for the pregnant lady since a lot of people kinda were intimidated once I yelled to the bus driver. Now i never once turned my head to the pregnant lady that was sitting next to me, I never did anything or said anything to her but I imagine in this state nobody would like to have a bad experience. I was at that time so done with life, suffering so much and now my mom has cancer instead of being healthy where we can go out and enjoy life happily waiting for our confirmation that she was going to travel to the States and getting ready for our luggage and stuff.My Mom unfortunately died of terminal cancer in mid September. I did my absolute best to take care of her, but regret not having petitioned her green card as soon as I turned 21 and being more close to her. I got too distant once I started community college and last time I visited her was Christmas 2014 when I was 19. I think either God or Life or Karma or everything combined is waiting for me if it has not already acted already. because I really did shock the lady and did not realize that I would regret it every day even the same night I got off the bus and more frequently and intensively after my Mom died . I thought about it and regretted it every now and then after it happened even when my mom was still alive. But now that my mom is gone I want to find a reason why my mom was gone so quickly and I just wanna die and I think I deserve death for potentially ruining an innocent child's birth. I now the lady can not have a miscarriage due to belly being pretty big but still I only got off 20 minutes after the incident happened and did say \" Excuse me, I am going to get off\" followed by \" Excuse me, I am extremely sorry ( Sorry by a million times in crude spanish). And it was regretful by rewinding to that time. Even when I got off the bus I was instantly regretful for acting so hot-headed and not knowing people in delicate conditions. I want death even though I have never really enjoyed life and there is so much I have not seen nor experienced.",

      "text": "From never-Trumper to pede: my awakening to goblindom First, let me say, that I am not an American citizen. I grew up in a nation where the two major parties are notionally one liberal and one conservative. It's a cosy Western liberal democracy, like many others, where the conservative side has been totally buttblasted by the slow march of socialist lite policy. We're the perfect example of Noam Chomsky's quote: \"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....\" I don't agree with much of what Noam says, but I think he's right about this.I've always been a conservative, but in the early days of Trump's rise, I am sad to say, I was right on the bandwagon. I thought he wasn't presidential, that he was incendiary, and basically that he was a narcissist or worse. Upon reflection, my reasons for thinking this were twofold:The media in my country is completely one-sided against Trump. I'm sure you think the US is bad, but let me tell you, there is not a single major news outlet in my country which is pro-Trump. For all their foibles, Fox at least gets a good chunk of pro-Trump info out there through the duo of Tucker and Hannity. Worse still, because I live in another country, I couldn't see, as many Americans could, how bad things had gotten, so for a while, I just assumed the media was accurate.Like many others, despite being conservative, I grew up in a liberal education echo chamber. Some of Trump's comments made me feel uncomfortable because they clashed with my ideological brainwashing, particularly around which views are politically correct to hold. So to hear (and yes, I know these were twisted out of context by the media) comments about Mexicans being rapists, threats about Muslim bans... well, it kind of got me a bit prickly with him in the early days.Two things were crucial:I think we underappreciate what colossal redpills these are for the uninitiated. Why? Because back then nobody had any reason to misconstrue his views or edit them into incoherence -- you can judge the man on his opinions as they really are/were. Some favourites (there are many more):Second, he was a lot less settled into his character of media manipulator extraordinaire, so he's a lot less bombastic. He's smart--he knows bombast is how to get the attention of the average voter--but being able to look back and see this calmer, more softly-spoken version helped convince me. I started to see that this was a man who cared his country deeply, knew what he was talking about, and was not just an overzealous reactionary--one of the fears the leftist media stokes quite successfully. The last point is that a lot of the interviewers in these older tapes actually with his views, or at least acknowledge him as a wise source of counsel. Why the sudden flip in attitudes? It's not like his views have changed -- in fact, that's the remarkable thing! He's been making more or less the same points for more than 30 years. What better commitment to principles can you get than that? In that way, the interviews were a turning point in that they made me see him as a man whose word was (probably) good, and that there may very well be a scam narrative afoot.I'm sure many others had this experience too. Diving face-first into a notorious reddit \"hate group\" proved to be a severely underwhelming experience. Expecting the worst, I found this place to be mostly for jokes (some of which go too far for my liking but hey that's free speech), political commentary, and support of each other. It gave me confidence that there was a silent majority out there, one which largely reflected my own views. Those views which I had been led to believe (by the college echo chamber) were so totally out of touch with the rest of the world.That was the last step for me. Goblins BTFO. The unfortunate part of this realisation is that I now view virtually all media as worthless, because you just don't know who to trust. There's a reason soap operas never end, it's because drama gets viewers. Similarly, people don't report facts anymore because there's not the market for it - they write narratives. Both sides spend great time crafting their heroes and villains, but for those of us in search of simple truth... I'm flummoxed. On the plus side, it's brought me back to thinking about my principles more intricately, and then deciding based on how my principles fit with policy, completely uninfluenced what some journalist thinks. Every time I stumble across a video in which some successful or influential person comments on the aptitude of Trump, I become more sure of being right. The two that spring to mind are: AND . If you have any others, let me know!I know that concern trolling is an issue in this sub, so I've phrased these as ways for us to improve (in no particular order) because I think that's important for us: In my country, we will most likely not, in the next 10 years at least, have the political will to even debate things like: substantially cutting the corporate tax rate, scaling back inefficient and overpriced health care, withdrawing from the Western-nations-shoulder-the-costs Paris Accord, or addressing the crucial (and obvious!) issue of putting our own citizens first. Trump's speech to the UN General Assembly was simply awesome. He hit all the key issues in one stream, he did not mince his words, and he has put the international community on notice. Whatever trials he is facing, be happy that you have got momentum on all of these key issues notwithstanding the Russia investigation (which is looking increasingly flimsy by the day). There are those of us around the world who are desperately waiting for our own Trump. For us, we just have to hope that things will continue as they have: that America will lead, and the rest of the world will follow.MAGA, pedes. MAGA.spez: typos, sources, formatting",

      "text": "When was the moment you knew your childhood was over? I didn't know it right that moment, but looking back, it has to be the moment my father commit suicide. I did not really go back to being a child after that. EDIT: I'm editting this because I got a few PMs asking about how I am and such. To tell the story, I was 12 when my dad commit suicide. His death was a great shock for me, as I did not know where he was (family declared him missing for a few days) and it really came out of nowhere. I remember that day pretty well. I went home from school and it was yet another sunny day.The alley I always walked to walk my friend home is in line with my street. We got to his house, said bye and I started walking towards home. After walking for a few more meters, I could sense that something was off in our street.There was a police car, right in front of our house. Little me knew that this was weird, but the whole situation was.I walked into the kitchen, where my mother was talking to two police officers.She looked at me and I could see her trying to hold back tears.She told me to go upstairs, to my room. Up in my room, there were my two sisters, the older comforting the younger one.I saw them both crying and immediately knew; \"Fuck, this is not real... Please don't let this be true.\" I was already crying, before my sister told me that my dad killed himself. I could not believe it. I hurled up under my blanket and just cried and cried. This feeling, knowing that your own father will never be here again, you will never hear his voice again and you will never be able to do anything with him. He is just gone. Forever. The following days were the worst of my life. More like weeks actually, but it felt like days.My body was not able to keep track of time and I had a lot of problems in school afterwards. I remember some days during that time, I was just \"empty\" and did not know how to react, move or feel.And imagine the situation at home. My mother (actually my whole family) was shocked and empty.We had a lot of arguments and the tension at home was enormous.Small tasks like cooking and cleaning were making us all angry very quickly.Also, who would talk about the death that soon and to a 12 year old boy, that is having big problems in school. I was lucky to be kind of popular and liked by people in school. I could make jokes and the likes, to distract me from the thoughts on my father. Fast forward to the next semester.I failed pretty much all my classes and had to go to a lower 'profile'.The class was great, but the situation remained. I still had lots of problems and couldn't concentrate. I remember several occasions where I felt the missing \"father advice\" or a \"father opinion\".It was just so hard to do a lot of things. Not just for me, but for my whole family. By now, I'm in a great place though.Life goes on and I am in a new school now, aiming for university.My life is getting better, but to this day I really miss my father and wish I could have another talk with him... If somebody wants me to keep expanding this, I'll edit it tomorrow.It's 02:38 and I am tired as hell, heh. Sorry for the bad formatting, on phone.",

At least I did, as she ended up leaving me for someone else in late August.At first, I was upset with her, and felt only spite towards her. Then, I began realizing how much I missed her, and fell back in love. About three weeks ago, I talked with her. While I didn't admit my feelings, I found out she was safe and happy. This made me feel like I can truly move on past her.She doesn't speak to me too often, which I'm pretty OK with. But the memories kill me. The days I was with her were the only times I felt truly happy and wanted. And I'm not saying I want to get back with her, however I do miss being loved like that. And I can't just not think about them; All I ever do is think. I am a full-blooded romantic, and have been described as \"very philosophical\". Whenever I'm not actively having a conversation with someone, I'm contemplating life and love.I have two particular friends and an adult figure who help me with my problems. Unfortunately, I only see the adult a limited amount of times per week, and I feel so bad constantly going to my two closest friends for help. It puts a lot of pressure and stress on them that they don't deserve.I also have a benadryl problem. I'm not addicted, however I'm not afraid to pop a few whenever I feel helpless.I get that people will miss me if I decide to \"end\" things, but it's so hard dealing with all this. I can't handle constantly feeling sad and lonely. If suicide is the only permanent solution, then eventually I'll have to resort to it. And as of right now, I'm not exactly against that.tl;dr: I've lost hope in life and in myself. I need help, but I don't know what to do.",

It's not as if anyone in my life notices, appreciates, or even truly cares about me. I'm no one. I'm the live-in maid to my family. I'm worthless. I am completely unnecessary. They don't need me whatsoever. So why do I continue with this life? I've even dubbed my own theme song to be \"Mr. Cellophane\" from .

I read a post I found in the depths somewhere the other night... it was from a train operator requesting people not kill themselves by means of the railroad because of the trauma it inflicts on the operator. While I understand that, this post finally gave me what I was a looking for- how I can surely end my life.I have been struggling for normality and comfort in my life for quite sometime after my life suddenly crumbled to a pile of constant spontaneous combustion. I'm not really sure where to begin there. If someone asks I'll share but I could honestly write a book as the world turns in my universe and people would think I was a good writer. I've been seeing a psychologist for almost 3 years now. She is very helpful but she can't change my chemical imbalance and she certainly can't fix the shithole that is my life. I am scared now though because it is sinking in more and more that this is who I am for life. I currently live with a railroad in my backyard- I literally mean it would take all of 30 seconds to be on the tracks and dead once I heard or saw a train. The fantasy of this is so fucking freeing but don't even get started on the nightmare of its reality. Tldr: I am pretty confident I won't lay down on the railroad tracks (or kill myself at all) but I have fallen in love with the idea of doing so.",

I guess all my friends and family members would be better off without someone constantly just causing problems and being one big problem. I feel that there's just no place for me in this world - and I have really tried looking for it. Doesn't matter where, I'm always a misfit.The best I could say about myself is that I'm probably pretty but even that I ruined with all my self harm - so there's nothing left. I feel like unwanted and useless decoration. What's it worth to be pretty if you're just a disaster besides that.People just always leave me - and if they wouldn't my fear and knowing that they will in the end ensures it - or at least the important persons, the ones I actually really care about. My life always just got better to only get even worse afterwards but I see an end soon. In the moment I don't even have the strength to properly and seriously consider suicide - because even that seems senseless - but I've recently just accepted that this will be my end. Maybe it will even last some more years but this is how it's gonna end. Every time something happens I'm a bit closer to ending it and there's not much left 'til I'll finally do it. I don't see anything left I could do. I can't have any relationships anymore. I'd like to be a person that could just focus on her career but I'm too unconcentrated, too distracted, too tired, too depressed. So I'm just existing and waiting.Not even therapists have been any help, even they don't seem able to understand me and all the 'standard' things aren't working on me. My current doesn't even want to make the diagnosis because for her it seems like a lot of things - but then again not hundred percent one of them. So I don't even have some simple words on a paper describing my problem. She doesn't seem to care that I'd like to know. I should better call her the last one because this week I just didn't go for the first time - I saw no sense in this. And I guess even she is sick of dealing with me. Everyone just expects me to 'hold on', 'try out new things', blaaa. For them it's very easy and they can't understand why I'm not full of hope because 'you're still so young'.I'm taking two antidepressants and have already tried two before it. Meditation. Sports (I hate sports). Everything is useless. I just don't know what to do. It just hurts to be alive. I don't want to be here.",

Whenever I want to talk to her she's in defensive mode and tries to not talk to me by any meaning. When I begged her to speak with me she tried finding excuses and ended up lying me that her phone died. I literally never met someone like her. She's the most perfect person I've ever meet. I've been dealing with depression since 4 years ago when my mom literally died crying for me.. I just wanted someone to love . I offered to pay for her to come in the UK next year and move with me . She agreed but now.. everything is ruined. I can assure you that no other girl is like she is. I wont ever find someone like her . My life literally has no meaning at all right now. What am I supposed to do? She is just hiding stuff and doesnt wanna talk to me. I know she was dealing with depression as much as I was but that doesnt make any sense. The guy looks like just a friend for her but I dont know why she was like that. I told her that im going to kill myself (which i think i will) and she didnt even tried to tell me not to do it. She just ignored me and told me to leave her alone. I was about to commite suicide before I meet her but she gave me a reason to still try . But now .....everything is gone. There are still alot of things I didnt said about her. There is no chance I would forget her. I just wanna be back with her but I cant do anything :(",

      "text": "Finding it pointless to keep on struggling in life My life up to this point has been miserable, for the most part. I was born with a speech disorder, so I was bullied until about 15. Also, being on the autism spectrem and having undiagnosed ADHD made my existence almost unbearable. In addition, my mother most likely had Borderline Personality Disorder and my father, perhaps, had narcissistic personality Disorder, which caused me to parent myself. I was forced to start working at 11 years old to buy, food, clothing and other necessities. I am now 21 years old attending University and am tired of struggling throughout my existence. Due to being hospitalized during summer and clinically depressed, I was unable to save up money for housing this semester. Now I have to live at my father's house, which is two hours away by two buses and the train from the University, so a total of four hours everyday. At his house, in addition to the neighborhood being located in an unsafe area, I have to sleep in the car outside, due to a massive bed bug infestation.I was homeless while attending University about two years ago, and lack the will power to do it again. I applied to campus positions that would have granted house, but, however, did not receive any of the positions. I am currently working weekends and saving up money until I can move out, which would probably three months from now, though that feels like a life time. I realize that life is unfair; however, knowing that life is unfair doesn't do anything to mend my soul. I realize that I must accept my reality as it is and keep on working towards a better future. Ultimately, however, I find it futile to keep on struggling through out my existence, especially for an existence that I ultimately lack control of. Plus, knowing in the grand scheme of things that life is utterly meaningless makes me want to end my suffering even more.",

I'm currently up typing this when I have to be to work in 3 hours but I can't sleep because I am still trying to figure out a way to not have to work tomorrow.But I also don't want pain, so I don't jump off the building I work at, and I don't go buy a gun. I don't try and pop a bunch of pills that I know won't kill me.Now, let's play through the scenario here; I hate working so I stop going. I have some money saved up so I can pay for my apartment for maybe a few months but after that I'm evicted. Then, I end up homeless.What if instead I call a support line or go to an emergency room and tell them I'm having thoughts of ending my own life? Then I get committed (been there, done that) for a few days until the hospital deems that I'm not at risk anymore, usually due to me just telling them what I know they want to hear. If I do that, then I'm right back where I started. Proceed to not go to work, get fired, and end up homeless.What if instead of telling the hospital I feel better I actually tell them I don't feel better, and I never will? Do they still kick me out? Do I get transferred to a state hospital where they just keep people who can't function and live out my days essentially a prisoner of the state? At least I don't have to work but man, I feel like the gun sounds like a great idea at this point compared to the complete loss of freedom.My point is, if I'm not going to be cured and I don't want to be cured and I never will be cured, it seems like the only two endings of my story is homelessness or imprisonment. Why can't society just give me a cyanide pill? Save everyone the trouble.",

This leads to the occasional interesting situation.

I t got heated and I was screaming commands, Align, warp, bubble bubble, Chylmidia Flamecrotch is PRIMARY shoot the fucking primary!!! Taylor Swift is Primary KILL TERROR SWIFT!! and it was a fun fight. Well, what I failed to realize is that Starbucks was pretty busy and instead of getting in line to buy coffee I looked up and had like 20 people standing behind me staring at my computer screen wondering wtf I was doing. Two of them happened to be cops in uniform and I thought fuck me, the guy came up and said ahh, you fly with test. Im a goon bro. The officer made a few bad dreddit is recruiting jokes and we actually sat and talked eve bullshit for like 20 mins. I wish I remember who the dude was but it was awesome. So yeah, eve is Real.

      "text": "Superhero movies need to keep things simple Batman: The Mask of Phantasm for the very first time and it inspired me. I'm no movie expert but I just love how ''simple'' and yet so deep the movie is. I feel like that movies goes way better into Bruce' psyche and showcases him better than any of the live action movies I've seen recently. I feel like that's the case because the movie keeps it relatively simple. There is a well written plot that's split in at least 2 plotlines: the Bruce inner struggle/relationship and Phantasm/mob/Joker. Along the way the 2 come together in a natural manner. It doesn't try to do overly complicated things. It just does what it does VERY well. It manages to explore Bruce's inner struggle and also deliver a mysterious ''villain''. Phantasm and Joker are better antagonists in this movie than any superhero live action movie I've recently seen. Ares in WW? Couldn't care less about him. Whatever that villain was in Suicide Squad? Couldn't care less. Doomsday and Luthor in BvS? Couldn't care less. I could now go into overanalyze mode, but let's just say they just weren't interesting. I had no emotional investment in them as a viewer. It's really crazy to me that an animated movie can do it so much better. Next to having interesting antagonists the protagonist also gets enough development and you are emotional invested into him. The movie has a runtime less than 1.5 hours and it still manages to develop the important characters more than enough. Nowadays I keep hearing that Marvel focuses on having less focus on the villain and having more focus on the hero. That would create a more fun movie while DC has more focus on the villain in movies like The Dark Knight and that creates an incredible ''dark'' movie. But an animated movie like this proves that you can focus on both, connect both sides and have an interesting story. Especially with Batman and Joker you could do a movie where the hero and the villain are explored both well enough because of the connection they have. Batman always walks on that thin line between killing and not killing while Joker tries to get him over that line. The Dark Knight came close to such a movie but in the end it still had more focus on Joker and it made Batman almost a side character in his own movie. I think this is quite complex subject matter because you explore the way how someones mind works. But they manage to keep it simple, that's why it works so well. They didn't try to over complicate things. Batman didn't have to fight a beam in the sky, there wasn't a monster destroying the city, he didn't have to save a bus full of school children while on the other side of the city a bunch of bombs would go off while the movie is also trying to set-up an other movie in the meantime. Superhero movies have become so messy. Just pick a theme or concept and stick to it. This is why movies like John Wick have done so well imo. That movie only cared about gun action and it did what it did good. When you watch a great Jackie Chan movie you can see the effort he put in all the action. Die Hard is also pretty ''simple''. Guy in a building, fighting badguys in there and saving the day. A Spider-Man movie should be something like this: Peter goes to school, Peter has it though combining his secret ID as Spidey and his normal life. Meanwhile a villain is up to no good. The rest can be colored in by adding some personality and development to the hero and the villain. The villain maybe had a troubled life and he does what he does because he is trying to save someone himself. Aha! Layers! He's actually not just straight up bad. But.... Peter has his duty and he has to stop him. Simple. No need for alien weapons or having to tie the movie into a universe. If you are dealing with a universe just have a newsreport in the back where you see Iron Man lifting a crashed car back into place. That's enough tie in for me. Animated Batman and Superman were in the same universe as well, but they didn't need to hit you over the head with it every time like in all the Marvel Netflix series, AoS or every MCU movie. This is how I'd do a Fantastic Four movie: just keep it simple. The F4 are well known heroes that are looked up to by the public. We don't need an origin story. Everything seems peachy but it becomes clear that to the outside world the happy F4 isn't that happy. They have doubts and regrets and are just human. Mr. Fantastic is sad he couldn't save his friend (who has become Dr. Doom) and that he can't help his other friend who looks like a bag of bricks. Thing desperately wants to become normal again but during the movie he learns to accept himself for who he is. Dr. Doom is super smart and is a respected scientist from Latveria. He has won the elections over there and has become the ruler of the place. He has began to reform the place and his country is becoming a danger to the world. His brilliant mind is making that country more powerful and is becoming a threat to the world. The F4 have to stop him, he walks in a grey area and is just doing what he thinks is right. Ideologies clash and Mr Fantastic feels like he has lost his friend since the incident. I think this is simple enough and you can build badass and fantastic moments around it. No need for a full origin story. Clever and simple writing can tell us why they are this way. You also don't need a beam in the sky. I bet every Hollywood writer that would write a F4 movie right now would end up with a huge Dr. Doom beam in the sky at the end of the movie. I'd make this Doom a bit more subtle, work more in the shadows and want to create his utopia by spreading his country. It could even have commentary on real world events. But he'd of course be using things as Doombots etc. And that's what will scare the world and also the F4 because they know what his intentions are. Make an ideological conflict the main struggle of the movie. I've gone crazy with this rambling, I just really liked Mask of Phantasm. Maybe it's worded badly by me by calling it simple. Some ideas behind it aren't simple at all but it's execution makes it seem simple and I think that's because of good writing. In the age of mass produced superhero movies there probably isn't that much more room for creativity and keeping things relatively simple because of all the focusgroups and different visions.",

I am 18 years old and up to this point in my life I've never cried myself to sleep since before last week. Ever since I graduated from highschool I've felt like there's no goal in my life and that there's nothing to look forward to anymore. I do not make any income, and I'm scared of getting a source of income right now as I feel like the only thing I would spend it on is a gun to blow my brains out with so I can finally stop hurting. My girlfriend never talks to me about anything anymore and I know she's falling out of love with me, I just don't want to live anymore, all of my past friends haven't talked to me in weeks, I haven't even angered them or hurt them at all and I'm sure it's because they just hate me, I feel like absolutely no one in the world likes me anymore and I just don't see anymore driving motivation to live anymore, I feel like living in an apartment by myself in a couple of years and paying my own rent would only make me feel worse and I just can't take this anymore, nothing even makes me happy nowadays and I can't even enjoy playing video games or reading without feeling like utter shit and feeling bored, and I feel like all I am is a giant bother to other people, im sorry if this is the wrong place to post this",

His emotional abuse makes me feel so little and so trapped.I don't have any means to get out of this house, financially. I work this dead end job at a place that I hate. I don't get paid enough, either. I'm graduating university in two weeks, but I feel like I accomplished nothing. I don't have good grades or a fancy job to show for it. So it was all worthless.I don't know where I'm going in life anymore.My therapist cancelled on me twice. And he doesn't ever show up on time. I relapsed. I relapsed hard.

Maybe it actually is active... i feel like if i had the strength id break my own neck. If i had the location and ability Id harm myself. I feel like Itd be one of those moments where id enjoy feeling my neck break no matter how painful. Sometimes, I get like that. Someday that part of me might come out more. Its what made me cut my hand open. Its what bothers me frequently about slicing my neck. Its like worse monster than just my normal suicidal thoughts.

Giving it in writing is best- a short note expressing that you will be moving on in your career, stating your last day of work, and thanking the company for the opportunity you have had there (note: it is acceptable to lie about this) is enough. If you have thoughts you want to share in an exit interview, you may ask if your manager would like to schedule one of those, although if you are leaving on bad terms or if you think your manager wouldn't take your suggestions well, you may not want to bring it up.

One of the books is a collection of fragments (in letters, diaries etc) that paint a picture of the people in post war Germany to the late 20th century and the other is a work of bleak historical fiction about flight and expulsion in late war Germany. His life was pretty interesting too, and most of his books are directly based on his experiences and his family. He was incarcerated for a 8 years in the GDR jail for alleged spying and emigrated to West Germany after his incarceration. He worked as a teacher until his success from his books made it possible to be a full time writer. Was there any success to the translation of his novel All for Nothing? Is he even known outside of Germany?",

      "text": "I feel empty and blinded by my past (long post). Hello I'm a Junior in high school who has social problems, so I suffer from severe shyness,and social anxiety due to me being introverted. Even when I get picked on/ also in class and I still talk my body still feels so shaky, and I fucked up in Piano Class I was trying to play Rock Along. My hands were full of sweat yesterday and it was noticeable that my voice was shaking. Anytime, I raise my hand my heart beats so when the teacher isn't looking I put it down. I'm too shy to ask for help and embarrassed by this. Same for my Math class, my mom was right \"If you have questions, then ask the teacher and don't come home clueless about the math HW.\" I suffer from a bad past. I got bullied in middle school and 5th and 6th grade for having dandruff. In middle school I told through counselor and she just gave the bully, what you may ask was the consequence? Only 2 lunch detentions and ironically that counselor was bullying me about \"(My name) if you have bad grades, i'm going to call your parents.\" Then, I told her that it was not right embarrassing me in front of my friends. She started crying and saying \"I'm sry.\" I gave her a 2nd chance and she refused to change my classes and said go talk to the principal :/. I literally even avoided to swear at her and that was attempting. I hope I never run into that bad counselor Ms. Dukes ever again. I'm so glad I left that school to high school, that bullying is not much a problem to me compared to in middle school. Also, my 8th grade English teacher humiliated me and saying that \"You have an F in my class. Gotta fix that F.\" I mean, I understand that I have a bad grade, but doesn't mean you can freaking embarrass me in front of the class. Then, I told the principal and he said he \"was sry.\" The next week, he said the N word and then said \"(my name) Hope this doesn't offend you, don't call your parents.\" He laughed like a complete idiot and don't understand why he hasn't been divorced yet. Someone in 6th grade asked me about this word and then I answered it in the way that it means. Then, he proceeds to say \"Eww, gross.\" He spreads the rumor about me in my class, and in this program W.I.N we have every morning, my friends won't sit by me anymore and I literally cried. The principal assigned lunch seats and I just sat there quietly and was a loner. This boy was bothering me in the lunch line, luckily I got him to back off since a teacher was there. He almost beat me up in the bathroom but I defended myself and fell, but I was okay. He ran away like a coward. After winter break, I started to be cool with them and told them not to believe that kind of stuff. I will never miss elementary school and middle school. I don't know how to find the scale factor of 2 shapes. I can't fucking take it anymore, and when I was younger, I would always slap myself on the side of my cheeks for being an idiot. Sometimes, I still do. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my head.I'm selfish I care what others think of me.In 6th grade, someone choked me and couldn't almost breathe for a minute was painful. I spilled soap on my sister's face because I'm a fucking idiot who does bad stuff and the wrong thing.. Then, I couldn't breathe again for a bit. I feel like i talk about myself too much and just am stupid. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not there at a place and just zone out for some reason. Why bother to feel live if there's not much hope? I keep stressing myself out and procrastinating a lot. I always had a thought of torturing myself with a pillow.",

      "text": "\"Drag is...\": What each winner brought to the art-form of drag [UDPATE] So, a year ago made a post about what each winner brought to the public eye about the world of drag. I think about that post like once a week, and especially recently as one of my friends is watching the show for the first time and flying through the seasons. So I want to revisit 's original post and contribute to it further!ORIGINAL POST: Bebe exemplified dignity and self-respect with her poise and respect of her heritage. In the first season, I think it was important for Ru to show the world drag was something to take seriously, and Bebe showed that in spades.Tyra wowed Ru with her showgirl runway looks and beauty, and in her best moments Tyra can still wow the world with her sophisticated beauty.Raja brought high-fashion to drag race at a level that no queen had before. She was less beautiful, and more walking art.Sharon forever changed Drag Race with her spooky, shocking aesthetic. She threw fishy out the window in favor of being freaky, messy, and weird. When in doubt, freak 'em out!At the opposite end from Sharon was Chad, an old school queen who had mastered her craft. She showed drag could be a life-long career, something to be treated as seriously as any other.After a string of winners with strong visual aesthetics, Jinkx seemed unpolished at first by comparison. However, her level of comedic timing and acting ability were unmatched by any winner before her.Spurred by a comedy queen winning, Bianca introduced drag fans to insult comics, and comedian fans to drag queens. She was miles away from the lip-sync talents of the first winners.Violet, like Raja, is also high fashion, but brought a young new viewpoint to it. She's a visual orgasm of burlesque, BDSM, and fashion. Bob brought humor and (questionable) fashion to the show. However, her heart is in her slogan, \"A queen for the people.\" In a climate of ecnomic inequality, racism, and violence, Bob isn't afraid to bring politics into her art.Alaska may have caused a bit of controversy on All Stars 2, but her perseverance won her the crown. From auditioning for every season, to watching Sharon win, to getting Season 5 Top 3 only to lose, and then to come back to All Stars looking like the goddam Queen Alien from the Planet Glamtron, Alaska shows that drag is not easy, but it's worth working hard for.Our current reigning was never shy to admit that she's a smart bitch, and proud of it. It isn't always subtle, but Sasha uses her intelligence to bring great fashion to the runway, teach about queer history, and educate the masses on love and acceptance. She showed the world that drag queens know a thing or two, and they use that to execute their art and connect with their world.",

Sometimes I just want to cut off my tits and fuck myself with a knife or something, then maybe the people I've hurt over the years by being a selfish slut would be a bit happier in their lives. I remember being feeling hope because of this TED talk explaining how the stress response was the body's way of telling us to seek help. I guess that's me, seeking help and feeling the slightest bit relieved even knowing help isn't coming and that no one will ever agree with me or love me again. I'm okay with banging against my coffin for a bit longer, I'm just tired of letting people believe I'm willing to be anything other than what I am, a selfish slut.",

When the time comes I really believe it is going to be as easy has feeding yourself, scratching an itch, or putting on a shirt. Something you just do without thinking, you just do it without a thought. I am genuinely surprised with this revelation. Almost let down, lol. I am not delusional.

Something where there is always a possibility of solving some time in the future. That little light of hope is no longer good enough. I don't care about possibilities anymore, I want something more absolute. I want something more concrete. I am tired of putting forth effort and not getting anything for it and the thought of well, keep trying, one day it will be OK, is no longer good enough. I have pretty much done it all to try and fix myself, and have had zero positive results. Not even close to being OK. It is a huge disappointment. I am so tired of trying that I no longer want to put forth any effort. Especially more effort into things I have done over and over and over.... for years. I do wish there was something no psychologist has ever told me, something ground breaking, a light bulb moment that changes my life forever etc.... but they are all the same and say the same shit. I have zero drive left. All used up. Either a miracle happens in the next 4 months or lights out. I thought my family would be enough to keep me holding on, and it was for a lot of years, but it isn't anymore. Sure, I love them and they love me, but love of others is not enough when you have nothing in your life to give you meaning and the feeling of accomplishment.

Hi whoever is reading this,After a very traumatizing event earlier today, I've found myself depressed, alone and frankly, unwilling to live anymore. I'm 21 years old and have been an emotional and very flawed rollercoaster of hurting and getting hurt for the past 7 years. After the final straw today, I decided to test myself. I'm heavily drugged up to the point that I'm pretty certain I'll either won't wake up or wake up to an event that will cause me to end it right then and there. The goal of the test was to prove to myself whether I'd be able to go through with 'it' or would some how find something to keep me going on this road to recovery with far too many set-backs.I've contacted the national hotline but they have told me they can only advise me so much because of the time. They have more people available at 8 A.M. which is in a little more than 3 hours.Fact is, I'm very unsure whether I'll survive this long with just my music and fading conciousness.

As I continued to grow up I promised myself I would never let myself live in pain the way I was for the rest of my shitty life.The depression comes and goes, but it always finds a way back to me. You know when you love someone, and you don't know how you can survive without them? My depression treats me like that, an abusive relationship that gets better and then hits full in dragging me down further each time.I can find a little bit of happiness and a little bit of meaning to my life. I can start to feel good and realize I'm really not that great of a person. I'm awful, and yes I would leave people behind, but to be honest they are far better off. I think constantly about how I could end my pathetic pointless life. I can't get a gun, but I'm also not down for just slicing my arms open in a bathtub (Rules of Attraction). I guess what lauched me the hardest this time is the fact that anytime I feel for someone I get hurt. I fall in love and start to feel normal, and it just ends. I haven't felt for someone in years, and I've known this person since we were children.I just wish I knew what was wrong with me. What I could fix to make me more likable, attractive, funny. I wish I knew what was wrong with me where no one can love me back.I made a plan a while ago to end my life on October 13th, and it made sense to me. It felt right, and this asshole comes in and makes me feel like there might be hope, and reminds me I'm shit.I can't kill myself on the next Friday the 13th in april because a family members birthday is too close to that date and that person means too much to hurt them like that. I have this October or almost a year to decide if I want this life anymore. The thing is I've given my life so many chances and I've tried to change my life and it's still awful. I'm still alone and yeah I have a few people that give a fuck about me, but I'll never get married or have friends that relate to me.",

      "text": "Just finished reading \"The Maze Runner\" (the first three books). Is it normal to have cared more about the story than the characters? (spoilers) I started reading a few months ago, and this is the 2nd series that I have read (the other being Michael Grant's \"Gone\" series). While I definitely enjoyed The Maze Runner, I wanted to know how you all reacted to the books. Note: I've only read the first 3 books (The Maze Runner, Scorch Trials, Death Cure), not all 5 books.What I thought was interesting is that I cared more about the story than the characters. For example, when Aris and Teresa 'betray' Thomas in the 2nd book, my reaction was not, \"Aw, poor Thomas. I don't like Teresa/Aris now.\" My reaction was, \"Wait, are they right for doing this? Are they telling the truth? I'm confused.\" I wasn't attached to the characters too much. I read solely to answer the question \"What is going on and why?\"I don't think this is a bad thing, I truly did enjoy the books and found most every story told in this world interesting. But I wish I cared about the characters more. However, to me, it felt like the story was bigger than the characters (Thomas). And I wish I cared more about Thomas. But it's hard to care about a character when their story is \"I'm in a maze now, how did I get here? Oops, did I do this? Sorry, let me not choose to not remember anything so the reader stays confused.\" Now in hindsight I can see this as Thomas's redemption story: Thomas helped to create controversial human experiments, realized they are bad, and vowed to take it down. Maybe if I read with the intention of sympathizing with Thomas instead of reading with the intention of understanding WICKED I would have enjoyed the books more. But in reading this the first time I was so focused on \"wait, who is telling the truth\" that I didn't invest into the Thomas's growth as much. Is this normal?How did you all feel about The Maze Runner series? When reading, is it a normal thing to care about \"the story\" more than \"the characters\"? Do writers make books for us to intentionally care more about the story? Any other feelings about this series you want to mention? Thanks for reading my wall of text!",

That's okay, I'm pretty active here and elsewhere on Reddit. Just looking for friends. :)I've suffered from pretty severe depression and high anxiety for most of my life, with suicidal thoughts a regular occurrence. I attempted suicide back in March when my employers threatened to fire me and then really lost my job in July. I was unemployed for almost ten weeks before finding a new job.Those ten weeks were absolute hell--I toyed with the idea of suicide every day, but could never quite work up the courage to attempt again...just in case I actually , ironically enough. Two weeks ago, I actually bought a rope from Home Depot to fashion a noose to potentially hang myself. It was a Plan B, as I saw it.Then I walked into a telemarketing firm and was hired on the spot. So I now have a steady job, 8-3pm, Monday through Friday. Seven hours at nine dollars an hour, plus five dollars in cash for every sale (which I'm rather good at, I've discovered--$55 in my second week, in only four days from my first sale on Tuesday). $1200 a month isn't too shabby at all, plus tips! :)So, things aren't as dire as they were two weeks ago. I was down to just over 5K in my bank account, dwindling fast and was getting more and more scared... So that's going to slowly improve again. I am now also seeing a therapist weekly (she even comes to my apartment!) and am very appreciative of that. My family is supportive and trying their hardest to help me in any way they can to fight the depression and anxiety I have, so that's nice.Thanks for reading.",

Social anxiety's got me covered. Making something of myself? Depression and scatterbrain forgetfulness will help me keep my motivation down and in my fucking place.It goes without saying for how badly I want to die. I've wanted to die this badly for years now, only able to ignore when I can both have something to distract myself and my own brain decides it wants to give me a fucking break with feeling absolutely miserable. Somehow I had it in my head that being at college would help -- force me into an environment where I could try something different. Be around people my age and hopefully learn how to be a human being that can laugh, drink, screw and enjoy other people's company.But of course that's not happening.Instead I've only dug myself into a deeper ditch where I can watch other people my age having friends, laughing, enjoying one's company while I sit here like a fucking statue watching them and constantly being reminded that I will never have the things that they have to make life worth living.And if I can't find life worth living, then what's the point of even trying? If anything, merely existing brings people down more than it lifts people up with how goddamned socially awkward I am -- not even getting started on other shit that's wrong with me.So yeah I want to kill myself, but at the same time, I know how pointless it to want it because somehow I can't help but think it's going to be yet another thing I cannot have. That I'll sabotage it, or some fucked up God in this world will lay the cards out to ensure I fail or chicken out at the last minute. I can see myself sticking a gun in my mouth and I fantasize about having the balls to pull the trigger before getting frustrated when I know that I don't have the balls and will never have the balls and just chicken out at the last second.It's at that moment when I go ahead and let that single instance in my head fade away that I feel truly trapped. Like I don't have any sort of escape unless someone kills me against my own will. Something I can't help but doubt happening because of how goddamned \"lucky\" I seem to be -- always feeling at the bottom of life, but always being just out of reach of happiness or prosperity for that tease to simply exist.Sorry if this rambling mess doesn't make any fucking sense, but the TL;DR I guess is that I fucking hate living and I fucking hate myself for not having the resolve to just end my life.

      "text": "My Story. So I had a shitty childhood. My dad was an alcoholic, my mom abusive bipolar. Three abusive older brothers. My mom started giving me sleeping pills when I was 8. Started on Zoloft when I was 11. Then the anxiety pills. Group therapy every day. First attempt at 14. Graduated HS a year late. Flunked out of college. Got a job at a nonprofit, where I've worked for the past 7 years. I have no friends. Everyone at work hates me. 3 years ago I made a friend. She got me into drinking wine. We went on trips at least once a month to go wine tasting, or go on booze cruises. Got into a lot of trouble. Had fun. Forgot about my mental illness for over a year. But now she hates me too. Everyone I meet in life either hates me automatically or forgets I exist after five minutes. So I just have my dog, and my cats. I try to get better. I'm on three anti depressants at the moment. I've done 40 treatments of RTMS. Speak to my psychiatrist and psychologist weekly. I've done DBT/CBT, more group therapies than I can count. Most recently, my doctor sent me to chemical dependency recovery because of my drinking and smoking weed. There I got taken off my anxiety pills because they're addictive. Last week my casemanager at CDR gave me two choices - to jeopardize my job by going to intensive outpatient everyday, or be 51/50'd. So now I'm in IOP. And probably going to get fired from my job because I'm out, again, for \"medical reasons\" Existence is shit. The psych meds made me fat. Stunted my growth. I've never been in a relationship. Never even been kissed. My entire body is basically scar tissue at this point from self-harm, acne, and HS. I don't sleep. I try to do everything to make it better but I just end up sabotaging myself. I'm just alone with my own shit all the time. So yeah. I guess what I'm trying to tell myself is that there's nothing for me here. I'm tapering myself off of all my meds at the moment. Then I think I'll be able to make things go away.",

      "text": "Why is Tlön the \"tertiary\" world? Last night, I finished an anthology of phantastical short stories, of which Borges' was the final piece. Presuming that (\"third world\" or \"tertiary world\") of the title is an epithet for Tlön, I am wondering what particularly accounts for the tertiality of it. Given the numerous allusions to philosophy present in the story, I am considering that perhaps this is a reference to the Fregean dictum (\"The thoughts are neither things of the external world, nor imaginations. A third world has to be recognized.\" - my translation; I have here translated \"Reich\" as \"world\", as this so happens to be the ubiquitous translation of the term used in translations of Karl Popper's similar theory, but a literal translation of \"Reich\" would be \"empire\" and an acceptable compromise would perhaps be \"domain\".) It cannot be a reference to the more famous use of the term by Karl Popper, as Popper's theories invoking the term were published in the 1970s, long after the publication of the short story. What seems to speak against the identification of the with the Fregean third world seems to me to be that, while it is certainly thought up (I do not know enough about Frege to make a distinction between what he considers thoughts and what he considers imaginations, and why the latter is not a subset of the former), Tlön is quite distinctly composed of imaginations, so it is not what Frege tries to sever from imaginations as belonging into the distinct kind of the third world. But perhaps the ground for the name is instead wholly contained within the story itself, viz. the reasoning that the world containing Uqbar is the \"second world\", an imagination relative to the \"real world\" (of course, the real world of the story is already an imagination relative to real world), wherein Tlön exists as the \"third world\" relative to the real world of the narrator. Such conscious reference to multiple layers of fictional containment seems to fit in with Borges' character as expressed by the themes he touches elsewhere in his works. Does anyone have any remarks on the matter, other speculation or perhaps even well-grounded information?",

It was a prestigious school that I worked my ass off in high school to get into, sacrificing a social life for grades/extracurriculars because I wanted so bad to get into a good college and have a great experience. Halfway into the school year I started getting very depressed and became anorexic but was seeking help outside the school for both these problems and was hopeful of my recovery. That was, until one of my teachers expressed concern about my weight to administration. What followed was months of back and forth harassment, threats, forced tests and evaluations that cost my parents money out of pocket, etc. including mandatory \"weekly meetings\" with one of the deans only to culminate in them forcing me to take a medical leave.I was in a certain program in this school where basically if I were to leave I would lose my spot in the program and have to start all over (more time at the school, more money for my parents, same classes over, bullshit). I had literally chosen that school because of the prestige of this program and the first year was a sort of \"preparation\" for the program and I already had befriended people in the group, was excited that all my hard work first year would finally pay off. It was really really stressful for me and my family and when I tried to go back the next semester, my application was 'denied' and I was still prevented from returning. Next semester- same thing. I have literally not recovered from this event and it has ruined my entire life and even health. Since this happened I've developed severe, life-altering chronic pain leaving me bedridden that therapists tell me is from the stress/anger of that situation. Both my mom and dad have developed emotional issues/anxiety having to watch me suffer. The dr bills that are a result of this event have piled up for my poor parents. I have watched all of my friends recently graduate and move on with their lives while I'm completely stuck. I had such a bright future, and it's literally gone. I'm so sick mentally and physically I can't work, and I'm so angry I could literally see myself murdering the people at that school that so unfairly did that to me (And still wouldn't let me return!!!)I cannot see any way out. I've been completely isolated from every human but my parents and doctors for the past three years. I haven't gone out with any friends or done anything a normal young person should do in all this time. I see zero future for myself without a degree and no clear path. And, the pain prevents me from even holding the most easy of jobs. There's legitimately no way out for me anymore. I've held on so long and I can't anymore. Fuck this world, the phony people incapable of empathy and understanding, and the unfairness that permeates through innocent people's lives and souls.",

I was bullied at school for my stutter so i had no friends and still dont at this point in my life. But this summer was the best and worst summer of my life. For the first time i was happy i met a girl and she was everything i ever wanted but after a couple of weeks she had to move back to her country and that broke me. I started to not eat, not sleep and just wanted to be alone. That also caused my family to hate me. They wanted to help but id push them away. Now a month has passed by and i come to find out she has a boyfriend. The thoughts of suicide were strong before but now they are even stronger. For the past month ive had that feeling in my stomach of butterflies or wanting to vomit and i cant take it anymore. Ive cried almost every day and though im going to therapy the thought of suicide keeps growing stronger. I was meant to start my second year of university but i told them i need a year break because i cant get anything done. Ive stopped taking care of myself and i feel bad for my parents. Ive already written a letter to my whole family and my ex in case i were to pass away but i dont know what to do. Its a matter of weeks/months now i dont see myself going past 2018.I know this isnt as serious as others on this group. I just wanted to say that i know it feels shit but i pray to god that something good happens in the next fee weeks. I love you all and it makes me so sad seeing so many people with the thought of suicide every minute. It shouldnt be this way. I wish you all the best and i hope you give god a second chance and stay here with us a bit longer. Theres a reason why you havent done it and you need to keep on believing in yourself. Im trying my best.",

I will pay for everything in cash and leave the remainder of my savings to my partner, my family and whoever owns the motel to make up for my mess.

If it's not then you can remove it but can you redirect me to one where it should be posted? I thought about posting for a while, but i didn't, but now i do. So I'd like to know the best or a good way to commit suicide. Now I don't live in the US, i live in a europian country. I've heard of all kinds of methods, including many different products. But It's not legal to buy a gun, and I don't really understand how you can get acces to these kinds of gases and pills, I can't really get them, i never really heard about any ordinary person just buying them either. I thought about the jumping method, but there isn't really any tall buildings around here, that i can just go in at least, i know of one but a few people fell from that and they survived so it's not really good. There are a few bridges but they are very low also, at least compared to the US, I don't really understand the physics behind water.There's a big one but it's really far away, and unfortunately I don't have the ability to get a driving license,and I can't imagine a scenario where a stranger just takes me there, but i refuse to use pulic transport.And apparently under the big bridge there's grass so that can modify some things as well. I've tried hanging a couple of times, but it didn't really work, at least as far as I understand I must have been doing something wrong. But in general there never seems to be an agreement whether hanging is actually efficient or not. I actually don't mind pain all that much, so it's not a primary concern,but I'd be really happy if there was a painless and preferably quick way, but i refuse to use blades and fire. Also I have to ask what about trains? I know what the general opinion is, but I'm a 270% selfish person, so.. yeah I'm really not into limiting my options. I am very sorry. A train usually goesy by not far from here, so it would be kinda convinient FOR ME (obviously), but again i don't know the efficiency. Thank you very much for the advice, Im trying not to violate any rules, but we'll see about that i guess. Thanks!edit: also i should mention I'm not going to read the replies regarding loved ones and a better future, im sorry, but I just cant handle them.",

You're going to die, that's true and I'm in no position to judge how that happens but to do it by your own hand is taking fate and whatever else we take for granted away, you're consciously taking away tomorrow and tomorrow all your problems could just go away.You also write about \"saying goodbye\" which makes me believe you obviously have people that care about you and in turn, you must care about them. Do you really never want to see your friends, family, or whoever again? Do you really not want them to witness your success and your future? Do not be irrational about this, death is the thing you have to be most rational about. It's cliche but the evidence tells us you only live briefly in this tiny gap of life between two infinite voids of darkness. This could be it, buddy, and you're going to end it early?! If you truly believe this and think this way and you're utterly convinced and you think it is the only possible solution (bearing in mind people with terminal illnesses and life sentences often decide again it) then you've got to at least talk to someone; someone you care about, about what you're going through and why. It's only fair to the ones you love.Personally, I'd say life is a lot more profitable than death because you're here and it's now. Death will come, just wait, that's all you have to do from damning the ones you love to a lifetime of sadness and regret. It's also good for you because meditating on this fact means you'll realise that you're not tied down to anything, problems are only ephemeral you can tackle them.I hope you talk to someone. Death doesn't hold an answer, it is only an inevitability.",

I'm usually pretty good at shaking off my dark thoughts, staying busy as best I can, but every time I go out and see my friends I see this look in their eyes like they know what a mess I am and are just biding their time with me until graduation. I had an ill defined relationship with the person who used to be my best friend my freshman year, but she moved on and found someone else and we began drifting apart, I got clingy, and I didn't respect their boundaries and tried to stay friends with both of them, and now they refuse to talk to me. I'm better than I was, but I still spend most of my nights alone, casual hookups stopped being enough of a distraction and I think it was just unhealthy. When I think about suicide it's so comforting, and oddly familiar. I think about a noose around my neck or a gun in my mouth or just jumping into traffic...and the worst part is how I think I'll somehow make everyone who hurt me feel like shit. I don't know where I'm going when I graduate, literally or professionally. I want to start my life and be a better person and the possibilities give me hope but I don't want to look back on my college experience as a low point, and that's how it's shaping up. A number of my relationships are too damaged to fix and I'm scared to keep trying, but more than that I'm scared at the realization that most of my problems are my own fault. I remember something I read once about the four faces a person wears in life-the first is what they show everyone and how they present themselves to the world, the second is shown to friends and family, the third only to one or two people, and the fourth you never show anyone, and that face is the truest reflection of who you are. My fourth face isn't what I want it to be, and I think it's just getting worse as life becomes more real.",

I could have literally ended it right there on the back roads by crashing into a tree. I just wanna fucking die. The worst that would happen to my family is they would be sad a few days and then get over it. I'm 19. I thought getting off my adhd meds would help. But, my problems are deeper then that. Recently, I've even thought of killing an animal or something to get anger out. I thought this way back in ith grade. Me and my ex friend killed a bird and burned it in the woods. I threatened to blow up a kid at the bus stop. I think of killing myself everyday. I bought a bunch of 10mg melatonin today. Idk if that'll work. I know a guy with a gun. I have money, maybe I can buy it from him. Maybe that will work. I thought it would get better, but no. It hasn't. I just don't want to live anymore. Please just fucking kill me. Idk why I can't kill myself. Maybe I was just meant to live in pain.I always said, I'll give it two years. Probably 2 years ago I said that. Maybe now is my time to go. Only one person I know knows how deep I am into this. And even then, thats not all. I have no respect for people or myself. I started cutting again yesterday. I don't fucking know. Maybe I should just kill myself. The only thing that has kept me alive for this long is music. It just distracts me from my reality I guess. It's literaly the only thing that I view as worth living for. Maybe it isn't even worth living for. Idfc anymore. Just thought I'd share.",

Someteimes i have bad days, i see where im standing and all the things i have stacked up. Sometimes when its hard to really motivate/ picture myself reaching something greater, i think maybe i should kill myself, sure at the end of the day i want to live, i want to achieve, but sometimes it doesn't feel that simple when you're in a bad moment. But hey this should happen to alot of people right? maybe i should try and stick this out for everyone else in my situation having a hard time.My father is bipolar, severely. Growing up with him has been an equally great and unique experience as well as it has been hard and mentally destructive at times. For context, ill elaborate on the most recent event where things have been terrible, but believe me his moods can be as frequent or infrequent as the weather.1.Dad meets new person through work(lets call this one Michael) 2.There is also a person staying with us right now( and this one Tom) 3. Michael comes over to see dad, meets tom 4. Tom and Michael turn out to both use the drug ice regularly 5. Michael invites 'friend'over to our place 6. My dad isnt a heavy drug abuser, but because of his mental disease he has sought out self medication at times when he is out. 7.For some reason as many times as it has happened, my dad still hasn't grasped the fact that if you're drugged up the night before work, work most likely is not going to go as planned. 8.When my father comes down off hard drugs, he becomes really unreasonable, and as he isnt properly medicated at the time, im the eldest son so i have to try and stop him from literally. Killing people.Now im in this situation where i this long to do list or white list on my mind of all the things i have to/shouldn't do. Dads always screaming and angry and annoyed, smashing stuff at times. The worst part for me is that he invokes chores onto me during his induced mood of rage. Sometimes intentionally sometimes not, whether i have to take it upon myself to support my younger siblings in a situation they cant fully comprehend yet, give my drunken mother the little pity i have left to her when shes being verbally abused.Back on topic though, sorry for ranting, i feel it may be god for me to vent though. I woke up this morning to all of which i just mentioned, the screaming, the fear of not achieving an early business from home because of the environment im in. The mental strains that are placed on me when i have to deal with my dads bipolar as well as the events that arise when he brings drugs into the house.I woke up with all this, and the anxiety was different, it wasn't just that worried pedantic feeling/mindset that i usually get. I felt pure dread, i felt so scared that i was feeling sick, so sad that i just felt weak. For the first time ever i placed my face down into my pillow with my hands clenched behind my head, in a complete state of fear and anxiety. I felt like i needed to commit suicide to escape this feeling, and i feel like this morning was the closest i have ever come to going through with it. My friends are not the type of people that can help me if i open up to hem, they'll just try to justify why i shouldn't, not what i should/could to do help myself, i have even less faith in my family.I do want to live, i have goals, they may seem hard but i do have dreams that will only be achieved through time and effort, but if i ever get the feeling that i had this morning again, i cant be sure that i wont want to go through with it next time. I NEVER want to feel that againTLDR; Living in an environment that is killing me/destroying me mentally. Woke up with the most severe and unbelievable anxiety i have ever had. I usually am able to move on and push through my anxiety and problems, but this morning was different. Asking for advice, i never want to feel what i just felt again, something bad will come with its next visit.",

      "text": "[Spoilers] I just finished The Road by Cormac McCarthy; these are my thoughts. I had recently finished Blood Meridian, so I wasn't expecting a happy ending. Despite this, The Road, while it was an amazing book, left me with a feeling of vacuousness and emptiness I wasn't expecting. I thought at the end, since there were so many allusions to the fact that the sun was no where to be seen, maybe it would end with them trudging along, still fighting off cold and starvation, but get a glimpse of sunlight as a sign of hope. Nope. The book wasn't nearly as disturbing as Blood Meridian, however the cannibal basement and the skewered, headless infant on the campfire (though to be honest I expected this when they saw the pregnant woman, call me fucked up) were certainly stomach churning. McCarthy did an incredible job filling me with the sense of cold, nothingness, despair and utter desolation in the wake of an unknown disaster. I hoped before reading the book that the disaster would be stated, but when I got into it, I realized I didn't care about what started it, rather what would finish it. As I was reading it, I was physically cold. I had to wear several blankets, and a hoodie as I followed the characters in their quest simply for survival. That's how much the scenery and environment encapsulated me. I found myself questioning what I would do in their situations and was constantly switching sides between what the boy wanted and what his father saw as necessary. I will say I was so happy when they found the bunker full of food, water and fresh clean linens. It was like an X-Ray apron being lifted off of me, and I was happy that they got to enjoy that little bit of sanctuary. All in all, it was a fantastically bleak read, and I look forward to reading more of McCarthy's works. For now, however, I think I need to take a break from the ever enshrouding doom and nothingness that McCarthy weaves into his works.",

      "text": "Okay, this is probably going to be annoyingly long but I have to get this out to someone. I'm sitting in bed, so upset that I can't even cry. I just got an email that my power bill for the past 30 days is $500. I live in a 3 bed 2 bath apartment in a small Georgia town with my boyfriend and our roommate. I don't know how on Earth we could have possibly used 3000kWh of power in 30 days, we operate AC reasonably, turn lights off, all that. The bill is due in 13 days and I don't have a job. My boyfriend doesn't have a job. I have all the experience I need to get a decent paying professional job. I've applied to over 60 places in the past month and a half and the most communication I've gotten is one single email saying they're going with another candidate.I've had major depressive disorder since I was 14 years old. I have a reasonable control on it, but right now I want nothing more than to just stop existing. I've been living on my own, with my boyfriend for about a year or so, \"unofficially\". He had more than enough money to pay for rent at our old place so he did. I was sort of in between my parents home and his apartment. Now, my name is just as much part of the lease as his. All of my things are at this new apartment and I hate it. Every single time I leave my parent's house I just sit in the driveway and cry. I rushed too quickly to be out of high school and in college with all my freedom. My downward spiral started when I wasn't accepted to my dream school, UGA. I had always said I'd go there, from the time I went to games and tailgated with my uncle and dad as a kid. But even with honors grad, a few AP classes, and a decent GPA and ACT score, I wasn't accepted. I graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA and honors. I skipped classes nearly every day, I never did my work, but it never mattered because I always had A's. College was obviously different, but I still skipped because my teachers never really did anything about it. I managed to end the semester with a 3.0 GPA, my only failed class being an annoying College 101 required course. I decided then that I wanted more freedom to work and all that so I applied to Liberty University Online, my parent's alma mater. It severely kicked my ass and I failed both classes on account of not doing any work. Now I'm here... I am trying desperately to start back at a tech school in January and try to transfer into UGA but life just keeps kicking my ass. I can't get a job despite having great experience and references; and I haven't even begun on my relationship.My boyfriend and I met on Tinder in August of 2015. I just went through a horrible breakup with my high school boyfriend of 2.5 years who thought it would be fine to break up with me via email while I was in Scotland on a school exchange trip. My boyfriend, who we'll call John, also went though a breakup a few months prior to mine. We met up and talked and eventually started dating. But he's now an entirely different person than I met. I know I am too, because people change, but he's too different. All he does is play video games all day. I love video games and I even love playing them for hours. But when it becomes the first thing you do when you get out of bed at 4-5pm and don't stop until you go to bed around 5-6am, it's a problem. He's perfectly content to live in filth. He rarely, if ever, picks up after himself. We have sex maybe once a month, sometimes every other month. I know he isn't cheating on me because he's just that lazy. Obviously the logical solution is to just leave him. I've heard it from anyone I've told. But as with all things, it's not that easy. We got a puppy together last year and have already agreed that if we break up, he's in a better position to take care of him. So #1, I lose my dog. He's also horrifically depressed but refuses to go to a doctor or do anything about it, and I know that when I leave him, he's just going to become some shadow of a person and that's not good for the dog or anyone else. I know it's not my responsibility what he does after we break up, but still. All of my things are at this new apartment. I don't even know how I would begin moving everything back to my parent's house. I'm horrifically out of shape and that's mostly due to the fact that my boyfriend is obviously too lazy to cook every day, so he normally just orders food 2x a day. We've somehow spent $40,000 since January and I don't know how. No extravagant purchases, no vacations, just a bunch of small meaningless purchases that add up.TL;DR I don't know what to do. I feel so stuck and my heart hurts. I've fucked up my life, I have no passions, I can't get a job, I can't go to my dream school, my relationship is terrible, I owe $500 I don't have, and I want nothing more than to just stop existing.",

He was in a depression, but never really talked about it just in the last few weeks. He could never be truly himself. All his life he pretended to be something he is not just to fit in with everyone's expectations. He was homosexual. I was the only person who he told it to and from the beginning to end I accepted this and had no problems with it, but he was afraid of other's reaction and how it would affect his life. I don't know the exact reason why he did it. I think he had other problems going on too. I miss him so much and at the same time, I'm angry at him for such an action. Leaving me here in this horrible world of pain. The loss of him made me rethink everything. I feel lost. I feel suicidal. I may actually feel what he felt before he left. He was a good guy. The best I ever knew. He was good hearted. He was everything a decent man should be. Rest in peace to him. He lived 20 years.",

I dislike being kissed, I dislike being held for long periods, I dislike sex immensely. It is painful for me and I feel miserable, disgusted every time. This partner has started suggesting that they can no longer go on with a \"loveless\" relationship, so I need to \"Shut up, and take it\" instead of telling them no. I can't do it. But I can't leave, either. I rely on them, live with them, financially we share our responsibilities and I'm unable to pay for our home by myself. I'm at my wits end.

      "text": "I'm just apathetic. What's the point of being here? I'm just here to make other people happy. So long story short, I had a boyfriend that I was crazy about. I was actually happy for once in my life and felt like life had purpose. We broke up after a year and a half about two months ago. He told me that he wanted to marry me. He almost proposed. He's now dating another girl for a month now and has told her he loves her and wants to marry her. I'm not naive to think he really loves her. The idiot just can't tell the difference between love and infatuation. Regardless, he's still a happy idiot and I'm miserable.So I'm going through the process of grieving. I went crazy and was very close to killing myself. The only reason I didn't is because of my family. I'm getting better. I've had moments where I've accepted it and am ready to move on. But the thing is, I think this is the best I'm gonna be until I find someone else. Like this is basically how I was before I met him. Just pretty apathetic about life. I'm starting to make friends, and trying to better myself. But for what? So I can force myself to tolerate this life so I don't kill myself to keep other people happy? I'm in law school and I'm trying to focus on the material, and do the readings. But I'm falling behind, because I just don't care anymore. I have to force myself to do this so I can get a job to support myself one day so I can tolerate this life. Sweet.Yeah maybe I'll meet someone else one day that makes me feel happy like my ex did, but what happens when he leaves too? Like my ex almost proposed to me. Everyone in my family loved him. I thought everything was great between us. Then bam, he's fallen out of love with me. Like fuck, how am I supposed to trust after that? And what's shittier is that I still miss him. I tell myself over and over that I don't, but I do. I would probably take him back, even though I tell myself over and over that I wouldn't. Or what if I never meet someone that makes me feel that way again? That's what I'm most afraid of. If I wanted to be in a relationship again, I could. Just none of the guys have had that spark that I had with my ex. I don't know what that spark is, but I'm addicted to it. Like I literally could never get tired of being around my ex. Like I almost wish I was the kind of person who needed some space, because I probably wouldn't be so fucked in the head. But I could literally spend every moment with that person and feel happy. Of course there's fights, and it's not always roses. But even the shitty times with him, are better than these apathetic moments. Life felt like it had purpose. Now it feels like there's no point. Now it's just me surviving and putting on a smile so other people aren't sad. Which I mean I get it, it'd be selfish of me to trade my apathy for their sadness. But this isn't fulfilling. This is just being another number in the world. I wish I just never existed. That way no one could be sad over me because they never would have known me. And I wouldn't hurt because I never would have known what life is. I wish I wouldn't have screwed things up with him. Yeah, he didn't buy me presents, or do things that I wanted to do. And that's shitty. That makes me a pushover and pathetic. But I was still happier being a pushover than I am for trying to have standards for myself. We aren't going to talk ever again. We aren't friends on Facebook anymore, and he blocked me on Instagram. The only communication I have left with him is just seeing his name pop up on the list of people who have viewed my snapchat story. And you know how pathetic I am? It makes my whole day when I see his name there. It's why I go out and try to have a life. So I can post pictures on there and so he'll see them. And then I feel depressed until he's looked at it. It's pathetic and sad. But that's what I am.",

I just....don't see why I should even exist anymore. I mean, I had to give up my cat because my last roommate/someone-I-thought-was-a-friend, but who really wasn't, gave me no other choice. She wanted to put him down, I compromised by surrendering him, the only thing I had that kept me clean and safe, to the animal shelter. She then, a week later, tied to shove me down a flight of stairs, then kicked me out of the apartment anyways. So I moved into the local homeless shelter, and it was not good either. God shoved down my throat 24/7, and my pentacle necklace confiscated, then kicked out of there because I said that I did NOT believe in the Christian god. Now I'm in that position again. I have less than 3 weeks to find a place to live, or I'll be homeless again. and this time, the shelter is NOT an option for me. I have one friend in this town, and his roommates won't let me move in, even though I can pay rent.Goddess, I just....I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm so close to harming myself again, and I just can't take this. I have nothing,and no-one, to turn to here. And there's nothing I can do. I just...I'm so fucking empty right now.",

I me few months ago a girl on a website, from a foreign country. We started to talk a lot and this until today, nearly a year. She told me she was major, in university, nothing special. Then, after many talks we started to have feelings and started a long distance relationship. She was shy and never sent many pics, but she totally looked like a young adult. Our relation became very serious, with family involved, projets about future and live together. Of course, we went to talk about sex and had sexual convos. Then, I knew that she is diagnosed bdp, sociopath, paranoid (i knew it before her lies) She lied to me about everything : age, past, experiences, studies, all. She is in fact really younger than me. Her parents thought she told me, but no, she lied to them too. This gap never bothered them, me I didn't know. When knew, I got shocked and hurted. (Her previous bf was 25, never bothered them)Problem is : her family and her father are ultra religious conservative. Since i was the first guy she talked sexually, they push me to marry her in few years. Despite the fact they know she lied to me. More, they threaten and blackmail me : If i betray her or leave her, they threaten me to go to court and law. Her brother threaten me of death. And since she is completely paranoid, she thinks I betrayed and told to her father that wanna destroy me like told before. Despite all my efforts to explain I never betrayed.I'm exhausted, I did many things for that girl, but she lied to me about all. I'm exhausted, I can't run away except suicide. I know too that her father and brother beats her with a belt.I don't know what to do, I'm exhausted and wanna die",

I hate work. Despise it. Corporate environments are the worst, last job I got fired because I took a few days off and my manager harassed me for \"Lower than expected productivity rates\" so I told him to suck my nuts, fired on the spot. I had a slightly easier job at a KFC, manager there berated me because I made a mistake. She had no interest in helping me correct it, just shouted at me in-front of everyone so I used up pretty much every expletive I knew and walked out.I want to make my own way, start my own business of some kind, something where I don't need to wear a suit or a uniform, where I don't have supervisors or managers but every time someone in this town tries they fail. A young lad had from here a promising career as a singer, had a lot of radio play and TV spots. Couldn't release a 3rd album and had to move back home. He hanged himself two years ago. Not even he could escape.I went to university, I had severe Bi-Polar episodes (Now diagnosed type 1) and had to drop out. I can't afford to go back.I can't even find someone to stick by me. If I'm not earning five figures I'm worthless, and that's from experience. So many dates have gone downhill after I drop the \"I'm not working at the moment, I'm just exploring different ventures and hobbies\" it's unreal. I figure there's definitely someone out there, I haven't given up hope (Hell, it happened once but we split for unavoidable reasons) but it's so tiring I just can't face more rejection.Every time I start my music up again (I'm a bassist and a ruddy good'n, if I'm allowed a moment of arrogance) and find band-mates they end up dropping out because it interferes with their work or their family. How the fuck do people ever form full time bands? Or hell I'd settle for part-time but even that's too much to ask from the local muso's.The only things keeping me going are my friends, but they're now miles away.

Killing myself is a personal choice. I just want to be rid of myself. My pain. My suffering. Not a single motherfucker understands this ongoing pain I feel. They don't understand how hard it is to resist the Devil's temptations. They don't understand how it feels to be a defect at birth. They don't understand how shitty I am and how I should've just died at birth. They don't understand how it feels to be the negative anti-thesis of their sister. They don't understand how it feels to have been treated as a socially incompetent idiot all their life by their sister. She doesn't mean anything bad. I know she doesn't. But she truly can't grasp the concept of how it feels to be a failure in comparison. I don't have a license. I don't have a job. I'm not active in voluntary work. She has it all. I think of her as a bitch, but I love her too. I don't know what I am, what I feel, anymore.And to be rid of this confusion and musings alone in my room on my fat, disgusting, putrid, hateful, contemptuous ass, I want to die and cease to exist forever.",

I'm not going to put it off any longer. This wasn't my first close call, but it was definitely the worst. I now know that I am no longer in control of my emotions. I now know that this goes beyond just a depression. I now know that I'm ruining my relationship with my girlfriend, the only thing I ever hold on to anymore. I now know that I'm a danger to myself and others. As long as I can make it through the night, I will finally go get help tomorrow. I really do want to change - well, I have to change - and hopefully this will be the first step in doing so. I am a little skeptical, it seems like a lot of the process is about \"goals\" and \"next steps,\" which doesn't sound like it will really help. I also worry I won't say the right things, that I won't get my point across and fully explain the way I'm feeling. I don't think I know anything about the way I feel to be honest. And in general, the whole process of counselling is very intimidating to me. This is probably my last hope, so again, here's hoping.",

I was supposed to visit for my birthday but i was unable to because circumstances changed and she didn't care. \"if you come up here, then great we can see the movie. if not then okay. you can just mail the stuff to my p.o. box\" ever since she left for school, she's been more hostile and it's been breaking me day by day. she can upsate me for 30 minutes straight before her next class and i dont even have to say anything...she has her own mental health problems and in the past has grown up to detach herself from emotion but in the past, she at least showed she cared a little. she gave up on me a while ago. stopped trying to help when i called her before my attempts when i just needed someone to talk to for a moment. (she told me she didn't have a reason to because i was going to try anyway). i tried... and i got close once but... i'm still here so. just a month ago, everything was perfect, we were okay and nothing was like this. now, i'm nothing to her. she hasn't talked to me in about 2 days but she uses all of my stuff because she has my passwords. she ignored my last message purposefully and has posted on literally everything and has even seen my posts on social medias and yet still decided not to even deal with me. she talks to her \"friends\" that have known her for 3 weeks over the friend that has been with her for 10 years. i'm tired of living and watching myself go through this pain again is just a reminder that she won't actually care when i finally succeed. she won't cry. it won't matter. she has her /boyfriend/ and her new friends. and i don't have anyone. i have my fucked up mental health. and disorders. and a emptiness in my chest that wont go away. my own voice in my head reminding me that i deserve to die because even this situation is childish. she knows all of my disorders and health problems and she literally doesn't care. holds stuff over my head. there's no hope. i genuinely just want to die. give up. not like i've got a reason to even do more.she can keep everything. my accounts. keep using all of my stuff. i don't even want it anymore. i don't want anything. i just want to fucking die.",

I cant focus in class, all of my grades are in the 60s or lower, and the campus counseling center has few resources for depression. I have no friends on campus, or off-campus. My family life is shit (both parents are unemployed and refuse to apply for benefits, younger sister has become a recluse). I'm isolated at home with only a driver's permit and no way out. This is pretty much how it has been for as long as I can remember. I never had a lot of support from my family, and the extended family that did care about me was rarely around because they lived hours away. I'm tired of hearing \"it will get better\". I've been hearing that for the past ten years, and nothing ever got better. Ten years ago was when the bullying started, and one of the long term effects from it is PTSD. I have nightmares about it, flashbacks at unwanted places and times. Since I became a loner in college, they've gotten worse, and instead of having them every few months, I have them once a week. It's a reminder of how things were when I was a kid, when I was alone in school and heard nothing but how stupid and worthless I was, or how the other kids wanted to do awful things to me and my pets. Even now when I have run into these people in the grocery store or anywhere in my small town, they continue to bring it up. It doesn't have the same effect it had on me when I was younger, but it's mostly upsetting that I'm stuck in this limbo of being abandoned while the \"stronger\" ones around me continue to succeed and pick on the weak. I'm broken. I'm tired of living like this. But will it get better? I want to believe that it will, but if ten years has proven nothing, then I'm afraid it will only get worse as time goes by.",

Im very convinced I can’t be fixed. The doctors there prescribed me Prozac a couple days ago, but it hasn’t done anything. My depression has came and went throughout my lifetime, but it’s been nonstop for two months now. It all started when my girlfriend broke up with me. I know this is very cliche, and everything everyone has been telling me hasn’t helped. “The first one is the hardest, you’ll come out of it stronger”etc. It just hasn’t gotten better at all. Im still very in love with her and she has a new boyfriend and it hurts so incredibly bad. I want to be happy so badly just nothing has really improved. I don’t want to go back to the hospital because I am already so behind in school. I don’t want to hurt my family and my 9 year old brother, but i just think how insignificant I am in the universe. Another thing that I think of is all the alternate realities there are and this is just one of infinite realities. I sound insane but it’s just what i think of when suicide comes to mind. I just feel happy when I think “ I won’t have to deal with this anymore”. I haven’t had a horrible life at all, I would consider myself lucky to have such a good upbringing after I saw some of the kids in the hospital. I don’t know what is wrong with me because i’ve gotten all of the help i could get. I just can’t stop thinking about her, and suicide. I have just lost the will to live. I can’t really tell anyone because they would tell my parents and that would just postpone the inevitable. I have just lost the will to live.

      "text": "[Discussion] The Death of Ivan Illich Hey guys. I recently finished reading Death of Ivan Illich. What a great book! I finished it with a lot of questions in my head, mainly:\"Where did Ivan Illich go wrong?\". I was hoping I can post my review of the book here and people would comment on how they would answer the question above. Here it goes:The story of a judge with power, beauty, position and fame who saw his world crumbling down right before his very eyes and all he could do was sit, watch, and suffer excruciatingly. The author tells the story from the perspective of Judge Ivan Ilyich.The story opens up with a funeral: one for Ivan Ilyich. A lot of characters are present. The author makes a point to mention two characters who were competing for Ivan Ilyich's governmental position. We hear from the widow that Ivan Ilyich has been screaming for 3 days before his death.The author starts with the birth of Ivan Ilyich. His father was a government official of some sort. His two elder brothers, one was handsomer and one was stronger than Ivan Ilyich but he was the one who was successful in the end. We hear the story of how he met his wife. That his relationship of his wife was one of both social prestige and love. How she was the prettiest girl.We hear later of some problems that occurred between them after marriage. How she became bored more times than most and how she asked him many times to abandon his favourite bridge nights and stay with her. He saw it as she trying to get him to be bored with her. We later hear of how he developed a distance from her. How he treated his wife as he would've treated his courthouse; with calculated respect and professional distance. His wife later was happy that he spent his time with her, but he was doing it as part of an act he was maintaining. There was no love there anymore.He hit his side, but he bounced back without a problem, so he thought. After a while, he faced many money issues, especially after moving out to another district. He had to keep up appearances and that meant that the life he had was slowly increasing its upkeep and couldn't keep up with his salary. He was always short on money. He never sat down with his wife to have a conversation with her. It was an act he was maintaining and trying his damnable best not to disturb the silence.Slowly but surely, the pain in his side began to increase little by little. It started with him travelling many miles to get a job with a salary of 5,000 rubles. His current salary was not enough.He slowly began to disintegrate after his pain. He started feeling it every time. Coming and going in short bursts. Every time he thinks its going, it hits back. The doctors tell him that they don't know. This goes on for around 3 months.His wife and kids one time enter into his bedroom where he was lying down and they begin talking about an actress they were going to see that very night and which show did she star in; how good she was in this and that show. The man was struck in horror on how they were caring for nonsense rather than caring for him. He was to the point of begging for someone to pity him; to pity him just like a child; to pity him and remind him of how fair life is and how happy he would be.He remembered a syllogism of all men are mortal. Kasas is a man. Therefore kasas is mortal. Ivan Ilyich mentioned thinking of Kasas as an abstract man, not of himself as Kasas. Kasas never had the schooling he had or the women he had or the power he had or the money and house and kids and job and career and authority and judgement and sanity and intelligence and strength and youth and prestige and fame and reputation that he had.A very important thing he mentioned later is that he thought that everyone was playing a trick on him by treating him as an sick person and not as a person who is about to die. He wanted someone to pity him as a person who is about to die, not as a sick person who, given the right dosages of the right medicines, would bounce up as he used to be. He wanted them to make it a big deal.In the end, he died shouting because he realized that he did everything wrong and the only thing that calmed him down after 3 days of constant horror shouting was his admission to that realization.I see this story as a cautionary tale about living. While Ivan thought he was living the good life, it only led to suffering and death. Not until hours before dying, does he realize that what he had thought was the correct way to live was, in fact the, cause of his suffering. Once he accepts his suffering and the inevitability of death, does he realize that the purpose of life is not to be the cause of suffering for yourself and others",

I'm not handsome, I'm not smart, I'm weird, I'm physically weak, I'm socially awkward and I always feel like I'm three steps behind in everything. It takes me way too long to understand simple concepts. I always seem to piss people off and everybody just yells at me all the time, even though I have no idea why. I can't understand people at all. People are always either criticizing, bullying or just generally talking down to me. I've had to take shit from people my whole damn life and there's nothing I can do about it. Relationships? I had a girlfriend recently who said \"I'm only with you because I can't find anything better, I'm so pathetic.\" You know what was funny about that? I wasn't shocked like most people would be, it wasn't like \"oh my god she's such a bitch.\" it was just \"huh, yeah, I get it.\" I'm not even depressed I'm just numb because I'm so used to all the shitty things that have happened in my life. Friends? I've made friends in the past but they always leave. I don't feel like I've ever had a close friendship, only acquaintances, but of course none of that is long term.I hate being around people anyway because most of them end up bullying me in some way; calling me a retard, or a loser, or a faggot or whatever.It feels like my body, my brain and everything just doesn't work the way it should. I'm clumsy, I'm slow, I always piss people off and I just suck socially. I can't even hold down a job, I've been fired from every job I've ever had.I did terribly in High school, I'm doing university now but it's just way too difficult. I can't understand anything.I'm not close to my parents, they're selfish assholes who only think of themselves and downplay all my problems. My mother just stresses me out and whenever I say I have a problem she stresses out and makes it all about her, I fucking hate her. My dad thinks men shouldn't have problems and just tells me to harden up, fuck him too.So anyway, I'm not depressed, but I want to kill myself because I'm just so sick of fucking everything up. Imagine you're playing a game you're not very good at, you don't understand the rules clearly, you keep losing and screwing it up and everybody around you keeps getting angry and yelling at you because you fuck up yet you're not sure why. that's my life. Most people would quit that game because they just can't figure it out, that's my life, I want to quit because I can't figure it out.What do?",

So many people, including my family, tell me \"oh, you'll get over it, it's all in your head, it could be worse\".But truth is, I fear my life can be over anytime just as much as someone with.. I don't know... someone with thyroid storm? I can't think of a good example, my apologies.But so many people think suicide is a choice, and so many people have made the decision to commit suicide, but for me .I didn't have time to say goodbye or write a note, because one second I'd be fine and the next I'd be rushed to the hospital because I swallowed a whole bottle of pills or because I ran into traffic. I find it hard to explain to people, even professionals, that \"I have attempted suicide, but I don't want to die. I'm not suicidal. I'm not depressed. I'm just scared\". I do not want medication because I'm afraid I will overdose on all of it and obviously I don't keep razors in my room (for some odd reason before the last time I was hospitalized my roommate kept one of his razors in the room, probably because it was new and he didn't have a chance to put it in the bathroom yet). I try so hard to protect myself from.. myself? If I have to walk at night, I make sure my boyfriend is walking with me or I get a ride. I constantly distract myself so I don't have to deal with the impulses. I have thought it could be SOCD or suicidal obsessions but I've been hospitalized and now in outpatient treatment for over a month and they can't figure it out, just pretty much throwing around random things like \"unspecified anxiety\" \"major depressive disorder with recurrent psychosis\" and the one that really confused the fuck out of me \"Tourette's behavior\" or some shit like that. I don't even have any verbal or motor tics, I just suck at speaking sometimes. I'm just so scared I'll take my own life without being able to control myself, I don't want to die and I don't want to live my life in an institution with bland food and shitty music.",

With that said, I'm not in a state of mind where I'd follow through with any of the thoughts. I'd understand if this post isn't allowed for that reason. I am feeling worthless however, I'll be 25 in a few days with absolutely nothing to show for it. I've went to college for a year, trucking school for about 6-7 months, have had 2 jobs with 1 being for about 3 weeks and the other being 2 days. Bottom line is I quit everything and now it's left me trapped turning 25 with barely any experience or anything. I also have a school loan from trucking school for 3 grand. That isn't very much compared to other school loans but it sure is when you aren't making anything. The problem is that I have a mild stutter which makes interviews really difficult to get through, especially if I get nervous. For that reason I didn't even apply for a job for about 6 months due to just giving up. A few months back I said fuck all of that and started applying to places. Got a few interviews but nothing turned out. Then I got a job from a temp agency which was the job I quit in two days so now I'm right back where I started! It's just a horrible feeling watching other people from your class in high school starting to graduate college, starting to advance in their careers and such while I have absolutely nothing. I really want to be a meteorologist as I've always been obsessed with that sort of thing but I need a job to be able to pay for gas and such to even go to school. The location I'm in is really crappy for job opportunities as the closest decent sized town is 20-30 minutes away so it's not like I'm in a city with tons of job openings or anything. I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for but I feel like getting everything off my chest is a great start.",

I wanted to kill myself, 3 years ago, but i had inspiration to know what someone need to know. I went to college, left a potential IT career, i was really good at it, and joined philosophy studies. I was thinking that i must gave life one more shot, maybe it will help stop the pain, the consciousness. I was wrong, it all just go worst. After hard reading and trying to understand all i can, i concluded that there is no point in life. I'm 21 and i can t stop thinking about god and worlds pain. These thoughts i ve always had them, but without knowing what they are.Don t know why i m texting this. A cry for help maybe. Maybe i want others to know my pain. Don t know. All I know is that in less than 30 minutes i am going to end this, stop the pain forever. How can someone live if they knows that there is no God? I never understood this. A religious man can have it all, faith and what ever. But for us, non believers, what is left? I hope God really exist and i could met him, i really hate him, he s the thing i hate the most. Either he exists or not, i hate him. Trully. I was undecided what to do, until i meet a novel's character, Kirillov. I finally know what to do. I m not some fanatic. But what is the point? Without o true meaning, a true destination, not one created by us, only to lie ourselfs, but one greater, what is the point? This world will never change, people will always fight, there no such thing as peace, as mutual understanding, true compasion. I will bear it no more. After this, all text and i don t feel i thing. As I knew it for years, something is broken inside me. Or maybe there is nothing to be broken, there is just a void. Completely empty, just like my hope for this world. How can someone eat without thinking about others who are starving? How can someone watch a tv show knowing that someone else have a parent dying next to him? Ignoring all this pain and nonsense, how can people do this.? To forget it all, what a blessing. I left a note for my family where I explained in more words my feelings and all such. I truly love them,and i know they love me. But i can t live my life, i can stand it. I was right all along, this didn't helped me at all. Soon this will stop.",

I've been clinically diagnosed with depression for about two years now and as you may know it doesn't really ever go away, it just sort of subsides. I think this is due to all the returning stress in my life. With the returning school year I'm once again going to high school. My high school is a special high school in a sense that it's especially bad. Other schools threaten their students with the prospect of going there, and it's not even an alternative school. We consistently are beaten by all the other schools in every academic area and the majority of our teachers have stopped caring. This sense of apathy has spread to lots of the \"intelligent\" students (causing a chicken in the egg conundrum).With my return to my school people have started questioning me about what I want to do with my life. Typically I just shrug and say I don't know, but truthfully, I really like art. It is my dream to write and/or animate a television show but sadly where I live the only job prospects are meth manufacturer and meth dealer. This brings me to another problem, money. My family is pretty poor. I live in a one parent home with two siblings, one of which is very sick and may very likely die soon. My father has also told me that his doctor had told him that he won't live past 60. He is in his mid fifties.Thankfully however, my family has saved enough for college. Sadly, we can only afford a bachelor's degree for both my surviving sibling and I.My plan is to kill myself sometime soon, or at least before graduation so that my brother will have enough for a master's degree and then some. I genuinely don't see the bad side to this. I may even be able to make it seem like an accident so that he doesn't have to deal with the grief of having a brother for a suicide case (if I can't make it an accident I definitely won't bring this whole scheme up in the note, that's just poor manners).In a sense, I'd really be killing two birds with one stone here. I'd be giving my brother a better life, one that he deserves, and I'd be able to die happily knowing that he got out of this shitty situation.",

But to be brutally honest, I think I'm just lazy?What is the difference of being lazy & just tired of everything that you give up? (I don't think I reworded/explained that feeling of mine well in that phrase sorry >_<)Now a days I just struggle to go out of bed or go to school. My absences are sometimes really illnesses (like fever, stomachache, flu, allergies etc.) But than most are just me without the will to go on.If you'd see my records, there's a pattern: An absence per week. Different reasons & different days of the week.& then I am not submitting the needed requirements for my subjects because I prioritize sleep & rest. Not like in the previous years I would try my best to pass the requirements but now, it feels like that I don't even want to. Maybe that's laziness or in what I would feel about that:This greatly contribute to my anxiety to go to school in which I have regularly felt for 7 years because... Bullying.\"Going to class? Well good luck, some of your classmates are going to bully you\"I'd use to just go to the clinic as safe haven, now technically I can't (they seem to have a lie detector now 😨)Even though my classmates, after 8 years, are incredibly kind now. My mind & heart has already associated classmates as being \"scary, mean & bullies\" so I stay away from them even though they try to befriend me.Meanwhile teachers are \"Terrifying & Unforgiving\" \"if you miss something just let them have it graded as 0\", since even before I would miss out on just a few requirements & whenever I was confronted by this by my teachers they wouldn't take it lightly & worse with other teachers inside the faculty room.My grades are drastically falling since 7 years ago. I love to learning new things but then these feelings of being blocked is not helping & pulling me.The wrongs I do, the suffering that i inflict upon myself converted into feelings of satisfaction.Everytime something bad happens, my brain will instantly reply: \"Ha, good! If you suffer a bit more & make bad decisions that will lead to permanent damage, you'll be able to commit suicide immediately!\".I try my hardest to hide these feelings from those around me.I am frequently attempting to make conversations around people & have a loud voice for recitations (actually that's just energy converted from fear instead of from confidence & courage).Today. I am pretty much absent again, instead of learning wonderful things that is being taught in school...I am researching about suicide methodsENDP.s.

My last friend is moving back home and just landed this really great assistant manager job and I should be so, so stoked for him. But I'm somewhere between heartbroken, jealous, devastated and in despair. I feel so left behind. It's just me alone in the city now and I feel like I'm going to lose him forever. I don't leave the house most days, I struggle to relate to people and I have a hard time maintaining friendships/socializing because I'm isolated between my mental stuff, my physical disability and the chronic pain. I know rationally this is not the end of the world. But god I feel like it is. I feel like this is it and now it's just me by myself in the same studio apartment for weeks on end. I am trying so hard to calm the fuck down right now but it is not working and that is a fucking problem when you live on the 7th floor of a highrise. I just..... if someone had told me 26 years ago that I'd spend my time struggling to get enough to eat, in and out of hospitals, fighting both my crumbling head and my crumbing spine and alone....seems pointless sometimes. Sorry folks....just venting I guess.",

Maybe I just want to write it down for the sake of conviction, I don't know.I'm 5'5\" (male, 19) and never had a growth spurt. I can't accept that this is my maximum height. The only reason it has not been so great an issue earlier is because I was previously given false hope by doctors that I would grow while being simultaneously being put on sex hormone therapy to accelerate puberty and as result speed up the sealing of my growth plates.I refuse to live being shorter than everyone. It is something that some people can deal with but I can't. I cant go outside anymore because being around taller people makes me physically ill and can induce panic attacks of varying intensity. I haven't left my house in days and the last times I did go outside I coped only by keeping my head down to avoid looking at anybody, and piercing my skin every time I walked past a tall person.Some time this week I'm going to meet my GP and ask about being prescribed HGH in hope of alleviating my suicidal thoughts. I strongly suspect he will say no as he does not believe I can get any taller and radiologists have already refused an x ray to examine whether my epiphyseal plates are fused. I considered purchasing HGH on the black market but I wouldn't know what I was doing concerning dosage and don't know if I would get the safe, genuine stuff or some other dangerous drug. Anyway, assuming that I can't get some HGH I plan to commit suicide exactly two weeks from now.There are, of course, also other things contributing to my feeling this way but my height is by far the main issue. I haven't had a genuine conversation in person to anybody outside immediate family and therapists for about two months and all but one of my friends (who isn't aware of how I feel and hasn't met me in person in more than a year) has not responded to any recent attempt to contact them online. I am therefore reasonably certain that while nobody wants me to die, I will not be greatly upsetting any of my friends. Indeed, given the fact that we only ever talk online anymore, and I haven't spoken to most of them in weeks, I doubt that they would even be aware of it.My family are of course a different story, but the people whose feelings I am most concerned about are my mother (who would probably be destroyed) and my Grandmother (who is already unhappy at the moment on account of being ill). I am unable to cope with the pain of continuing to live, but also unable to cope with the pain of causing them such upset. I need advice in this regard, I feel conflicted between my firm intentions and what it would do to the people I love.Anyway that's the situation. I wanted to write it down somewhere, thanks for your time if your still here.",

I do know that looks aren't everything, but everyone has their priorities, one of my priorities is to look good ( which doesn't mean I don't try to be a good person) and well I don't. No matter how I style my hair, what clothes I wear, etc. nothing will ever change the fact that my face isn't pretty. Hair, clothes, make-up etc. can make you look like the best version of yourself, but none of those things can change your face. I know this pretty girl, she can have any guy she wants, every day I wonder how it would feel to be her. Guys ask her out, they want to do her favours, they want to spend time with her, she can just decide what to do with them. She goes out and spends time with guys and men she doesn't even like just to kill time, while I never get a single date. I can't decide what guy I want, I can't decide who I want to go out with, I can't decide whether I want to be friends with someone or be his girlfriend, because I'm ugly and I have no '' cards '' to play. I'm not saying I want to be like her and play with guys' feelings, just that it would be nice if I had more choices and freedom when it comes to dating, I don't know if you understand me. And lastly, I just think it would be good for my self-esteem to wake up, look in the mirror and conclude that I look pretty. I mean, I'd simply feel good and better about myself, it would cheer me up, regardless of how many guys I can or can't have. I'm extremely serious about suicide, there are a few things I want to accomplish before my death, I'll be alive for another 2 years I think but not much longer.",

Halloween used to be my favorite holiday as a kid, but now I'm in my 3rd year of college and all by myself and I hate what ive made my life into. My roommates are all out drinking, the people below me are having a wild loud party, and I'm stuck in my room lying in the dark trying to pretend like I'm dead, since that's what I want to be right now.I dont care what the doctors said, I'm pretty sure I dont have depression. At least not if we define depression as an irrational state of hopelessness and misery. I can rationally break down and analyze every one of my hundreds of problems and catalog in meticulous detail every stupid choice I made that left me a broken man child with no friends, no social experience and no useful skills. Its all my fault, I played to many video games, I watched too much porn, I was too afraid to ask out girls, I was paranoid about using social media and fell out of touch with all of my acquaintances, I chose to lie around dreaming about all the things I wanted instead of working towards them. It's all my fault. I as a person have failed at the game of life, and if I stay alive now ill just be prolonging my period of regret. I'm 20 years old, older than many of the heroes in the books I used to read and love, but I have the life experience of a 12 year old. Every weekend for the past 6 years has been me sitting by myself in my room. I usually dont even do anything except think and daydream, at least people who spend their lives addicted to WoW have something to show for it. I'm such a loser that I cant even find another loser to be my friend. I don't know why I'm never invited anywhere or why no one seems to care about me, but its probably something obvious I'm just too stupid or arrogant to see.I feel so small and scared and weak when I'm around my peers. I can only imagine the amazing things they've done that ill never even get a peek of: parties, drugs, sex, music, friendship, connection, purpose, victory, intimacy, I don't think ive ever even had a decent conversation with anyone not within my immediate family. Worst of all is how I see people improve, I've watched people who struggled with similar issues to me rise up and overcome them. Theyve gotten in shape, made friends, found a career path they like, became attractive... Ive tried to do all of that but failed utterly and completely every time. I've struggled against myself for years trying to turn my pathetic existance into something that could bring value to the world but I just can't do it. Something innate in me holds me back and keeps me in my place, at the bottom. Ive never won or achieved anything in my entire life and theres no reason to think that I will. I've been searching for years to find something I can be passionate about but everything I like I'm terrible at and everything else just bores me or makes me embarrassed. I've missed my window of opportunity for finding a normal, happy life. Now all I'm doing is running away from all the pain and regret I've earned like a damn coward.Ive tried therapy and meds, but they cant fix a problem that's not there. The problem isn't some chemicals in my brain or a traumatic childhood or whatever. It's Me, fundamentally me. Who I am is repugnant, useless and burdensome. I don't know when I broke or if I just came this way out of the box, but I cant imagine there's any way to fix it. You can't fix lazy, or unmotivated, or cowardly, or weak, or idealistic, or guilty or shameful. Some creations are beyond saving, so they should just be thrown in the trash to make room for something better. The trash is where I belong, let someone better than me take my place. I'm not a victim of depression or anxiety, I'm an unlovable parasite who needs to be smashed and cut and burned and made to suffer before I'm snuffed out. Thats the only reason I haven't done it yet, I feel like I dont deserve a quick or painless way out. If I wasn't such a pussy I would go and light myself on fire or jump in a trash compactor or something. Maybe my life can be used as an example of what not to do, of how to become a disgusting, whiny virgin betamale who cries in his room during the biggest party holiday of the year. I had so many opportunities handed to me I must be the worlds biggest screw up to end up where I am. I'm at rock bottom right now and I don't think ill be getting back up.",

Once example is the strong detailed narrator of the one and the stark absence of detail of the other book. Or Lauren's being a \"sharer\" and The Man's \"doing what must be done\" to protect the boy.

It was so scary the second program was so nice and it gave me hope, everyone there was so nice to me, and i met a girl that ill never forget. But of course i was too scared and nervous to ask her for her number, its been close to 2 months since the last time i say and i cant get her out of my head.

Not to mention Dr's don't want to hear me out or help they don't care ( at least not in this city ) I have no religion o PLEASE do not come at me with that but that is it a not so young 30-something year old guy I see no other way out.",

      "text": "Growing up, I got bullied and teased. Ive always been the kid trying to be in the in crowd, trying to look cool, trying to be popular. I tried so hard that my best friend in elementary school doubled as my bully. (She wasn't my only bully) I never physically got it but man were those kids mean. I got bullied literally from 5 years old to college. Everywhere I go... it turns into some form of bullying. At work, my bosses.. or even coworkers. I once got into a physical altercation with my roommate because I wanted her to stop using my as a verbal punching bag. I was an asshole too so don't feel too sorry for me. I once told my now friend that I heard screams in my head whenever I looked at her hair. I know, what the fuck is wrong with me right? This was like middle school. I bullied this one girl from elementary school to senior year of high school. We are now friends, I sincerely apologized after we graduated and never bullied her again. I am no longer a bully..I grew up my whole life thinking I'd be a rapper and when I got famous I'd say FUCK ALL YOU HOE ASS BULLIES, FUCK YOU!! Or maybe I'd forgive them and just motivate some other kids who got bullied. Idk, I wanted to be an inspiration and change the world. I wanted to be like Kanye West. My favorite rapper of all time. But even Kanye broke my fucking heart..he used to be for the black community and struggles and uplifting black people but all he cares about is money now and clothes and rich people bullshit. Im a fucking virgin. Im overweight. Im a 22 year old virgin and im a girl!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK.. I never even kissed a guy.. other than one time in 8th grade during truth or dare. ..until recently. I was on the train coming home from work and this guy asked if he could kiss me. I guess I looked rougly decent that day. He probably had low standards though bcuz he wasnt that great looking either. Anyway.. dude asks to kiss me and I say why the fuck not because YOLO right? I have NO friends... My phone broke recently and I realized that I didnt even need it because I dont need it... The only person who texts me is me is my younger sister who's 19.. I had a great best friend of 8 years. It would have been 9, but I treated her like utter shit and I touched her in her sleep. What kind of fucking asshole does that to someone??? To make matters worse, she's straight and had no feelings for me whatsoever. We talked about me liking her and her not liking me before I did it. I hate myself straight up. I apologized to my friend many times, she said she's not angry but she doesnt want to be friends anymore. I completely understand but I just hate myself for this shit now.. Its embarrassing, everything. Im tired of this life. I dropped out of college because Im bipolar and have ADD also.. so school is fucking hard and I flunked 5 semesters. I shouldve graduated by now but Im 2 years behind.. maybe more.Ive never been in a relationship.My mom had a talk with me last night and told me that nobody celebrates failure. And she was telling me why people dont like me. This may sound bad, but she was coming from a good place and out of concern, her tone may not translate because of the way Im writing it.",

      "text": "Hey guys I just needed some advice and made a throw away because my ex knows my reddit account.Okay so me and my ex broke up about a month ago but we still talk everyday, we still have sex sometimes, and we also sometimes hang out (and it's a lot of fun, we laugh a lot!). He broke up with me because I just wasn't that good of a girlfriend and did some pretty mean things and things just didn't work out and he just needed space and didn't need my life in his hands (I threatened suicide many times in order to get him to stay with me, manipulative and shitty I know.. and I know better now). After a long time of crying and feeling suicidal myself I'm finally just okay about things between us. Today he told me he's been feeling so suicidal lately and the only reason he won't kill himself is because of his little sister. He feels so alone and feels like he has no real friends. His family sent his to a RTC for 2 years and he has this resentment towards his parents because they sent him away because he pissed dirty but not when he tried killing himself (so he knows it wasn't out of them caring about him). I told him so many times that I care about him and love him a lot still but he just doesn't feel it and believe it.In my communications class we learned about this thing called a \"love language\" and long story short he really only feels love through service (actions) and I really only feel love through affirming words. So for a long time we were just not sending love that is catered to each other because he would always show me but never really tell me and I would always tell him but never really show him. Okay so anyways, I want advice on how to show him I care and love him through actions, this was my first real relationship and i'm still rusty on what to do. I want him to not feel suicidal and depressed. ** How do you guys feel validated and loved through actions? what are some things people do that makes you feel good about yourself and life? **I know this post probably belongs in the relationship subreddit but I would never go there for actual advice and him (and I) being suicidal just felt like this was a good place to go, since I OFTEN post here on my main account and I just feel so comfortable expressing myself here (but also I do delete my posts after my episode goes away)thank you",

There's been a long line of tragedy in my family and I don't think I can allow my grandparents to experience that again while they're still alive. They raised me since I was born and I love them more than anything. They've lost so many loved ones including my uncle who I never had the honor of meeting. My aunts husband whom was an honorable man. Siblings, relatives, you name it. I think I changed after I became diabetic. I never treated my girlfriend the same ever again. I tried my best after getting back together with her but my moods were never the same. I became angry at the smallest things and I tried to fix that. But I got more complications with my oral health and my mental health and my relationship was never the same. I got cheated on and ghosted. She pretended nothing was going on as she spoke with me online. I knew she should never moved to another state but there was nothing I could do about it. I just want the rest of you to enjoy life. But be careful of who you trust. I saved her from suicidal thoughts and depression three years ago. But I think I'm on the same path now. I just wanted to hear her say respond to me. I tried messaging her and calling her all week to no avail. She was with him. I just can't believe she didn't treat me as a human being. After all we've been through. I just wanted to tell you how I was sorry for everything.I have an MRI scheduled but I don't think I'll have it checked. My sis is having a baby and that's what excites me the most. I've learned more in these last 2 years of my life than I ever could have dreamed of in my first 20. One thing I think I would regret is not doing things that make me happy before I go. I love spending time with my grandfather. I love him more than anyone on the planet. I've forgiven my mother for abandoning my family when I was born and I've been trying to limit my swearing. I never should have begun in the first place.If I had to impart any piece of wisdom to my brothers and sisters in the struggle, do things that make you happy, don't be filled with regret or anxiety. Regardless of when you want to go or how you want to go, I'm not here to change minds or have my mind changed. Surround yourself with the things you care about and the people you care about regardless of your final decision.",

When I am all alone and walk around in the kitchen I often catch myself imagining me just taking whatever tool and ending it, just like that. And ofc. I've tried to find the easiest and least painful way to do it, I just cant. I cant stand the thought of ruining my family's lives, just because I dont feel happy at all. Most of the time I'd rather feel like living a hell, but there are moments in which I just feel like snapping, and go ignorant; ending it. There is absolutely no doubt that, if I didnt have a family or any friends, I would end it all. I seriously dont want to talk about this to anyone I know, or generally anyone in person, I dont want to be treated differently because of it. I have been thinking about calling a suicideline but I find it so odd to call them up and be like: \"Hi I feel like commiting suicide\".

I didn't know him very well as i was around 8 or 9 at the time but when he died all I remember is my mum lying with my dogs crying her eyes out. I now know this is because my mum didn't have a dad growing up so she saw him as one. my great grandad dying caused my mum to become heavily depressed which soon progressed into alcoholism.My mum being an alcoholic. it has been going on for around 5 years now but I will just tell you all the times I can remember that are significant. First one is around 3 - 4 years ago my mum got shit faced and left, we found her a few hours later (I say we but it was my brother and dad as i was 10) and she came back and yelled then passed out. second time was a repeat of 1 just around a year later (it happened a few times.) 6th time (biggest) it was November 5th and my family was throwing a bonfire for some friends of there's (they used to be mine but I will get to that) and we made a huge bonfire behind our house in a field but we left our mum and her friend because it was cold and they didn't vcare but by the time we had gotten back my mum had drank around 3-4 bottles of wine (the equivalent of a pint of JD) and was out of it. later that night there friends have gone, my brother was sleeping in my room because he was scared of my mum (as when me and my dad were directing our guests back as they were wattlking) she had being saying things to him like \"do you want to die\" (she was drunk) later that night we woke up to the sound of my mum banging and yelling at my dad \"Alan, I need a fucking wee\" then started throwing stuff and smashing stuff so my dad called the police and she was put in a drunk ward for a 12 hours. final one for now, it was around june and my brothers girlfriend was around and he had bought me some csgo keys and made me a coke and rum (i'm 14 so there was 10:1 coke to rum) and he had left like 100ml left and it was gone so he asked my mum and she started freaking out yelling at my brother girlfriend to get the fuck out of her house and that she is not welcome and the same at my brother and sines then (around 2 and a half months I have seen him once) and I had to spend the night at my mums friends house and she didn't pick up her phone and knowing how she is and what she has done before I thought she had slit her wrists and died this time.moving 200 miles away. After what happened my parents decided to move back to the north of england, moving closer to family I see once a year and 200 miles away from friends. I now have 1 friend ish and see my cousins once a week and am living with my grandma who is a compleat bitch (my family are still in nottingham and the reason i'm not friends with the other family is because of moving) Also school here is shit and all I do really is sit in the lessons, do all the work, do homework at lunch and come home and eat. basically my life has gone from worse to worse to worse and I truly believe there is nothing worth living for now",

We talked about heaven and how nice it will be to be there one day. It was a nice moment, a memory to take and I was ready...Beneath us is the garage where I have ready my car, a length of hose, duct tape, a pvc step down adapter, (homemade) for the tailpipe, note written and last will made (short considering all items Ive owned worth anything are long gone). The reason you are reading this now is because of something he said...after the last story, I kissed his forehead, said \"you are the best parts of me, you are my favorite person, and you are a good son.\" He said, \"I know daddy, Im a good boy, Im good at school, I listen to my teacher, you are my best friend, and you will teach me to grow up, right?.\" Those last 9 words fucking gutted me... I literally sat on the steps in the hall shaking and sobbing so loud and hyperventilating I ran outside so as not to wake anyone. That uncertainty of how his life will turn out is my greatest source of turmoil. I think he will be better without me, but what if? What if my wife gets with an abusive asshole and this chain comes full circle?... I was ready man, tonight was it, I have given it all I got, there is nothing more, its broken and lost and Im ok with that but I have to go...and tonight, if only for tonight, my son pushed me back.",

I hate myself and it was the biggest mistake I've ever made. My self hatred is through the roof and my depression is at an all time low. I don't know what to do. People at my work are talking about it and I brush it off ass a rumour but every time people ask it pushes me closer. I've tried to kill myself in the past but this is a new low for me. I threw my blades away ages ago but times like now I wish I hadn't.. I love my boyfriend and he's the best thing in my life. He's a blessing and I can't lose him so I haven't told him. A close family friend said that living with the guilt is punishment enough, I've devoted myself to being the person he deserves but I keep breaking down.

Dick 48 years $6.95 The Strand NYC 202 The cover is a combination of purple and pink hues with a golden woman wearing a strange head contraption. I am still unsure as to which person this is or This is the first SF Masterworks book I've touched. Stiff binding, the cover is thicker and synthetic feeling. It has a strange smooth feeling to the touch that I found enjoyable. Very quickly the story seems complex, like a cheese emitting unidentifiable odors that seem to complicate the experience. This is most likely due to the lack of up front explanations for . I felt unsure at first that I was tracking the story properly. PKD did not keep me lost however, and each detail that was explosed felt timely and still held me in suspense. I am always interested in stories involving mental powers and was felt early on that I would stay interested. The technology in the world is a combination of antiquated and futuristic. Some may find references to old technology off putting and destroy their ability to see a vision of the future, but the timelines is elastic in such an interesting way that I can only hint at without ruining your own experience. There are some scifi concepts that are detailed and interesting enough to cause an immediate imagination attack, but the book felt held me in the same grip a murder mystery \"who and where is the bad person lurking\" story. I felt I never knew what was really happening, and as I fought to understand I was sharing the experience with the characters who were fighting to understand what was happening. This only exacerbated my own tension as the reader, and I loved it. When When the information begins to truly surface, I felt I should have known all along what was happening as it was cleverly hinted. A more intuitive reader than I may have seen the truth. I however, was rapt by the story and the fear and the to see the cause. I loved the explanation of the \"fight\" that must be experienced on \"this side of the glass\" and the lack of all answers provided in a buffet of finality made the ending more enjoyable. There is a moment that drags out for an eternity, it fills you with despair, anger, shock, sadness, my thoughts began to feel like they were reaching my consciousness through a mud bog, dread bubbling up like magma from a hungry volcanic monster seeking to drag you down into an unexplainable anxiety that highlights PKD's ability to play my emotions like a virtuoso. Every time I believed I knew what has happening I was incorrect. PKD is in charge, not you. It was all revealed or misdirected in a masterful way. I am thoroughly enjoying PDK, and thanks to this sub's PKD fans I chose Ubik as my second title of his. I'm a believer. This book is a short read, and power packed with thought provoking concepts and imagination stretching circumstances. You cannot read this book without enjoying some part of it, and I guarantee you will enjoy the moment I referenced in the Finish section. 94/100",

After two failed attempts,I think I am well prepared this time. 2 days to go To be honest,I have no idea why I am posting this.There doesn't seem to be anything that could potentially stop me at this point.Medication doesn't help even after the psychiatrist upped the dosage.It never did help.Besides,everything just gets worse. At first,I tried to get rid of,or,at least,supress the thought of killing myself. After my first attempt,don't care.I have now,however,accepted and even embraced my actions towards suicide.Who knows,maybe tomorrow will be a better day.Not ideal(nowhere near that) still awful in fact,but not as bad.I know though that it will only delay the impending.I know that I will most likely kill myself in a few days time,at max,and I am fully okay with it.Thinking about it makes it eerily scary in a way.Not the thought of dying and eternal darkness.To be honest,I don't even know what I am afraid of.I never really felt like \"myself\".Like I am \"me\".Never felt that I deserved what I have,and didn't deserve what I don't. I can't even find that bit of \"me\" to truly realize what I really am.Who I really am.I constantly feel like I am watching someone live their life in first person,rather than my own.This god-awful fucking feeling never leaves.It always makes me uncomfortable and awkward.It all was a result of one problem of mine That one fucking problem that lead to my ailments doesn't even matter anymore.Nothing does.I was just in despair for I thought this problem is one I can't solve.Once I realized I can,it was too late.I stopped caring.That was the point of no return.I simply do not care.And not because I am an angsty,cynical,ungrateful teenager,but because I can't.All of my interests suddenly disappeared.But so did that problem,in a way.Many more appeared,though. It is much worse now.I can only find comfort in music.Not always,but god,does it feel fucking amazing.Euphoric even.But I am sure it's not enough to stop me.And if it somehow is,what even is the point of continuing on this journey of pain and suffering others call life?My psychiatrist told me my condition really is fucked and it would take me 3.5 years minimum to fully recover.He tried to stay silent about the maximum.I found out that it could follow me to biological death,or,if lucky,last around 15 years.Don't know how to end this post,so I am just going to stop now",

I have avoidant personality disorder and my version of it is very effective and efficient. I don’t know anyone; I isolate myself because I’m ashamed I exist. I was an abused and neglected child, I never received treatment when it might have helped, the person that abused me hid it very well and the other adults in my small family were incompetent and inactive.I started fantasizing about suicide when I was 10; this was triggered by circumstance, not biology. I didn’t tell anyone, because it would have resulted in violence and mockery. I have always been desperate for life to end.I tried to kill myself as a teenager, but it was a weak effort and I spent a few months in a locked psychiatric ward. After I got out I went to school for a while, then I just stayed home. I lived as a shut-in for over a decade, spanning my adolescence and early adulthood. It was allowed, I was sick, but no one intervened.I tried to kill myself again, this time violently, again failure. Only a month in a psych ward this time. When I got out, I got my GED, and a job. I tried to pursue normalcy for a few years, but failed. I have never felt comfortable around other people. My brain malfunctions, it feels wrong to be looked at, it feels wrong to communicate. I’m ashamed and embarrassed that I exist.I was left alone with my mother as a child. She was mentally ill, emotionally disturbed, overwhelmed, and unmedicated. She wanted to pretend she was alone. She would beat me, belittle me, and torture me in the hopes of keeping me quiet. I can still see the rage and hatred in her eyes, the disdain and contempt in her voice.She won. I’ve spent my entire life trying to pretend I’m not here. I wanted to love, to be affectionate, to be outgoing. But I don’t want to bother anyone. I don’t deserve anything.I’m not dangerous; I’ve never hurt anyone and have no desire to. That’s the worst part, I’m weird and I know people identify me as weird. When you're a man and people identify you as weird, they fear you. I understand, its best to err on the side of caution, but people being afraid of me or thinking I’m potentially dangerous breaks my heart.I’m going to kill myself. The way I see it, I have 2 choices, isolation or death. I can no longer maintain isolation; I’m out of resources, so death it is.To make sure it gets done this time, I have 2 options. If the first is too hard, the second only requires a moment of bravery. It’s violent, but guaranteed. Neither option has the potential to harm anyone else.I’m not here for sympathy, just to be heard for a moment. And to let the younger people here know that the sooner you get help, the better your chances of recovery. If you can ask for help, do so. I don’t have it in me, but I wish I did.Just remember, there is no cure for mental illness, but there are people that can teach you tools and skills that will help you manage it and gain control.I’m going to die because I see no other choice, if you do see choices, please, make the choice that allows for a better and longer life.I love you.Thank you for reading.TL;DR: I’ll be dead soon, do better than me. Taker easy.",

I've already failed out of college right after high school. Decided to join the army, eventually got kicked out with less that than a year to go in my contract. Never got a promotion after joining. Never got in trouble for anything, just passed over again and again. I was a medic and a damn good one, if I say so. After a few years, I decided to go to nursing school. Took all the prerequisites, got into the program at my local community college. Gonna take 20 months, graduate in October. Failed mother-baby nursing. Retook it and passed. Supposed to graduate in December. Made it until yesterday. Failed the last real test. I'm now out. Credits don't transfer, I can't afford anything else. I have nothing left. No friends, nobody who cares. In the last few weeks, the only people who have called my phone have been telemarketers or scammers. I don't know what else I can do. I've decided to drop my dog off at my parents and then shoot myself. I've been into the psych center once already for suicide hold, I'm not going back. This is the last letter I am going to write. I offer these few things to people. Life doesn't get better, it gets worse. Nobody cares about anything except what you can do for them. Money or looks are all that matter in life, anyone who tells you different is lying so either get rich or get beautiful. Material objects will NOT make things better.

I didn’t care, I just wanted to feel good in the moment, I wasn’t thinking about who would suffer [which was me most of the time] and what the consequences would be, I just wanted to be happy, even if it was for a very short amount of time, I wanted to at least pretend that I could have long lasting happiness in my life, whether it be in the form of games and toys I stole money for, rebelling against my elders because I didn’t [and still don’t] like being told what to do even though they only had my best interest at heart [at least i hope they did], seeking the company of unsavory, unkind, or immoral people because I wanted to feel acceptance so badly that I was willing to LITERALLY pay for it by buying them stuff, and seeking the companionship of animals, because I figured, “At least they won’t judge me for my weirdness.” My ‘weirdness’ being my interests and demeanor. The only people I feel I’ve ever been able to be my true self around without fear of rejection are my online friends who share many similar problems with me when it comes to dealing with depression. My inability to effectively be around others in a public or a ‘real life’ setting without at some point driving them away stems from my insecurity and angst. Yea, a grown-ass 25 year old man has angst. Maybe other people my age do as well, but that’s besides the point. First off, I’m a nerd, of epic proportions. I collect Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, watch cartoons, draw and buy comics, the works. But I’m smart enough to realize that those interests aren’t enough to repulse 95% of the people I come into contact with. My insecurities are, however. These insecurities stem from my fear of being rejected due to my interests, which in turn, cause me to act like a complete ass to people because I believe they think lowly of me because I what I like. I figure, “Well, they’ll never see me as anything other than a loser, so fuck ‘em, they don’t deserve my respect.” Yea, real smart thinking. Thinking which at some point, no matter what group of people I end up with, causes me to do and say very annoying, weird, and sometimes offensive things to them. And when I DO get rejected, it only fuels my insecurities and projections of other people looking down on me, causing me to become angry or frustrated. Not hard to see why I’ve never been able to keep or even have real friends for most of my life. Despite that, however, there are SOME people who have the good grace to put up with me and my stupidity. Ironically, these people usually tend to be very religious. I guess you would have to be blessed by the holy spirit to be able to endure my nonsense. Or maybe there’s some truth to what Bill Burr once said, how assholes seek out wonderful people to be around because other assholes won’t put up with them. And while I am more than grateful to have my best friend of 7 years in my life, the fear of losing them always lingers over my head, like its an eventuality with me, that I’ll never be able to have a stable lasting relationship with another person. The majority of why I feel this way, I suppose, comes from my relationship with my family. Now let me say one thing before I go any further. I love my parents, and I love my siblings. And even though I don’t agree with of like some of the choices they’ve made in life, that fact will never change. Then again, how can I say I love them when looking back on my actions in my youth, particularly between the ages of 7-15, and how horrible I was. As I mentioned before, I used to steal. A lot. Particularly from my father. I’d use the money to buy childish things to enjoy, not caring if I got caught, at least in the moment. I couldn’t happiness from other people, I sought it in objects. I also used to beat up my siblings and say really mean things to them, probably because I got bullied a lot at school, and didn’t know how to vent my aggression and anger. My little brother got it the worst. I’d pin him down, punch him, slam him into things, say horrible horrible things to and about him. My mother see this and say, “What’s wrong with you? Don’t you realize your brother looks up to?” Looking back, I really could’ve messed my brother up and helped him grow into an awful person like me. Luckily, my brother is smart, and knows not to follow in my dumbass footsteps. So do my sisters. Things weren’t always bad between us, I still remember days when the 5 of us would just play together and not hurt each other. Funny enough, these days often involved us doing very stupid things for fun, like jumping off the roof, and or ‘wars’, in which we would grab anything that wasn’t nailed down and hurl it at each others’ heads. Still, the cruelty I showed towards them left an impression and later showed as we grew. The thing I regret the most was something I did when I was 13-14. In my youth [ages 4-5], I was a coward and sometimes called my dad to sleep in the bed with me when I had nightmares. Around my early teens, there was a night when my youngest sister, who was about 6-7 at the time, walked into my room and asked if she could stay in there, because she was afraid of the dark as well. I told her to grow and leave, to which she did, in a very saddened voice. My youngest sister asked me for help, help with something I suffered with as well and one point, and I flat out rejected her. Some brother I am. As we got older, I calmed down a bit and tried to form better relationships with my siblings, but they rejected me at every turn. Whenever I’m at work and talk about my siblings and people ask me if we’re close, I smile and lie, saying “yes.” I can’t blame them at all, I don’t in anyway justify of defend my actions, but instead try to make sense of them to myself if no one else. Part of this aggression that I had [and still have somewhat] inside of me is likely not just from the schoolyard bullying I endured, but also the discipline I received from my father. I can remember as far back as my time in pre-K that he’d hit me. I can even remember the first time he struck me. He was trying to teach me to tie my shoes and I just couldn’t seem to get it, so he smacked my hand with one of this shoes [he wore size 12s lol ouch]. The beatings would come mostly from my lack of good grades in elementary school. He would sometimes pick me up from school and bring me to bathroom of his office and spank me with his belt when I got a low mark. The worst 2 beatings I remember were when my mother was out of town and I tried to sneak up on my dad and scare him as a joke, to which he replied by chasing my to his closet where I tried to hide, and kicked me when he couldn’t pull me out to spank me, and the other being when he hurled a chair at me when I was 8 for not bringing my books home from school. For a while I thought this was something every kid felt with when they got disciplined by their parents, but talking to other kids made me think otherwise. I can even remember being sent to therapists as a child, because my parents were so concerned with my grades that they thought I was mentally ill, and when therapists would ask me if i got spanked, I’d lie and say no, unknowingly doing so out of loyalty to my folks. I wasn’t the only one who suffered my father’s wrath. He later went on to slam my mother into a window for not aborting my youngest sister, a fact I would later use as fuel for a horrible comment I would tell my sister when we would fight, “Dad never wanted you anyway.” Christ, I’m a scumbag. My dad later had a stroke when I was 9, and died when I was 14. My mother, bless her heart, did and continues to do her best for all 5 of us. She’s not perfect, but she loves us, even when she does some questionable things. There have been times when I would talk about how my father would discipline me and she would say things like, “That never happened,” and then would go on to say things like, “If your father was here, he’d knock you on your ass,” when I would disobey her or act out. My mother has a knack for getting under my skin, she knows just what to say to get my so angry that I have to leave the room or the house. Not surprising when she brags about how she was a bully in her youth. If there is a god, maybe me getting bullied so much is some sort of cruel irony thrust apron my mom by the vengeful spirit of god. Anywho, my mother later became the main disciplinary force in the household after my father was unable to do so due to his illness. It wasn’t as bad as having it be my father though, 1 being due to the fact I was a teenager and much bigger at the point, and 2 her being a woman made the blows less painful as well. However, getting hit in your 20s usually doesn’t prompt the same response as it did when you were 6. One day she tried to hit me for forgetting to do something small, I can’t even remember, and when she swung, I blocked her hand and pushed her to the ground. And that was the day I got kicked out the house. I lived at my grandparents’ for the next few years, until I eventually moved back to help my mother with her current problems. One thing i found very interesting is one day when my mother took me out for my 24th birthday, she asked about my future plans in life. Embarrassed because I didn’t have any, I asked her, “What did you want to do when you were my age?” She simply replied, “Find a safe place.” This made me think back to all the stories my mother would tell me how she would endure physical and emotional abuse from her brother and mother. My grandfather, her father, and the best man I’ve ever known, thankfully, didn’t inflict any abuse on her or her brother and sister. Thinking about that comment and my past, it troubles me to think that my mother likely believes to she failed in finding or making a ‘safe place’ for her and her children. Around the time I turned 17, I began to turn a new leaf. I wanted to have a good relationship with my family, I wanted friends, maybe a girlfriend, and respect from my peers. However, I soon realized in my idiocy in my younger years, I had missed out on learning social skills and had severely damaged my relationship with my family. And while I DID want to get better, I still continued make dumb decisions, like put off my studies and say mean things to my siblings. My family also said [and some still say] very demeaning things to me. So I trained myself I have no or very little reaction to them, even though they hurt. This indifferent demeanor I developed caused them and other people to see me as uncaring or cold. Despite my efforts however, I’ve often been told that I have ‘resting angry face’ or always look very serious or sad. I continued on, seeking help from people I found online who seemed to have similar issues with self-loathing and feeling like a failure. And after some serious soul-searching and looking back on all my missteps, it became apparent to me that my likelihood of finding another human being in real life I could truly do right by would be very unlikely. So, I turned to animals. I figured if I could at least do right by another living thing, that I wouldn’t truly be evil. Because even if I cleaned up my act, changed my attitude about myself and other people completely, it wouldn’t undo all the horrible things I did. But, if I could care for an animal, and never bring harm or allow harm to come to them, I could find a way to live myself. I began to invest most of my time at home with my dog, bringing him with me wherever I could, allowing him to live my room when I could and sleep next to me in bed. He’s been with me for 10 years, and I love him like family. Recently, he ran away, which caused me to become very distraught. For 4 agonizing days, I get home from work and walk around the neighborhood and surrounding areas, shouting his name, looking for him in every space he could possibly be, asking people for possible tips and even offering a cask reward. I even sobbed when it occurred that I might never see him again, whether he got picked up by some random people, or was killed. The thought of me failing him was too much to bare. Luckily, he was returned to me safe an sound. But I began to think, what if he got out again? With my luck, he might be gone for good next time. I thought, “Maybe if I get him a companion, something that’ll help him WANT to stay home, he won’t run off again.” Which brings me to what prompted me to type this little essay on my stupid existence. A few weeks ago, I went to an ABC to get the addresses on my driver’s license and state ID changed. I arrived there early, and saw there was a Petsmart across the street. I decided to go in, thinking I might find some good supplies for Deuce [my dog]. I found that this store not only sold pet supplies, but also offered pets for adoption. There were birds, lizards, turtles, fish, and cats. That’s when I first saw them, my kittens, Sophie and Sapphire. Two small black kittens, curled up together in a cage against some glass. “That’s it!” I thought. If I could just adopt these cats and introduce them to Deuce, he’d have companions. This, of course, was another awful decision on my part. Not only did I not have the first inkling on how to properly take care of kittens, but there was no way in hell my mother would allow MORE animals in her home. Despite me knowing this however, I chose to adopt them both a few days later [pursuit of happiness n all that]. I figured I’d learn how to take care of them and after having them in the house for a while without my mother knowing, and then revealing to her that they haven’t made a mess, and also using the fact that I’ve been helping her ever since I moved back in with her, she’d allow me to keep them. Flawless logic, I know. Well, 1 the kittens DID make a mess, like one of my coworkers warned me they would, and 2, it didn’t take long at all for my sister to discover them in my room. Right off the bat she told me, “You need to tell mom soon, or I will.” After doing my best to convince her to give me more time, I managed to clean up the mess made and plan my next move. Sophie and Sapphire had time to become well acquainted with me and my room in the 2 weeks they were there. I became quite fond of them as well. I hadn’t had time to properly introduce them to Deuce however. He had flees at the time and it was recommended to me to keep the kittens away form other animals with flees and to slowly introduce them to other animals in the household. Then a realization dawned on me. What if my mother wouldn’t let me keep them? What if they got sent back to the shelter they came from? What if they got separated? What if they were adopted by someone who wouldn’t take good care of them or abuse them? I decided that if worse came worse, I’d find a new proper owner myself, someone I could stay in constant contact with, someone I’d interview myself to see if they’d take good care of the kittens. There were many takes, many were collage students who wanted one kitten for a companion. However, I desperately wanted to keep them together because they were sisters, and wanted them to at least have company if their owner didn’t give them enough attention themselves. Then the day came, when my sister told my mother about the kittens in my room. I braced myself for the verbal lashing, the name calling, the curse words, everything I expected to happen after enduring it for so long after I went against my mother’s demands. Then, to my utter shock, I got a text from my sister that said, “Mom says you can keep them if you clean up the roach pills off the floor in the laundry room and put them in there.” I couldn’t believe it. Things were going to be alright, I could keep them, I could give them the care and home I promised to give them. Then, as if god himself decided to give me the finger, I got another text saying, “The cats have got to go, they gave me ringworm.” Then everything I feared would happen happened. What especially hurts about this was how my mother and sister assume that I don’t care that my sister got sick from the cats, that I’d gladly risk their health by bringing animals home, that I care more about cats than them. I had no clue that the kittens were sick, and wouldn’t have brought them home if I knew otherwise. And I would’ve also paid for any treatment my sister required. Despite that, they have every right to be angry with me. I was forced to find the kittens a new owner, someone who I thought would be a constant contact with me, but who is now unresponsive to me. I fear the worst for my cats. I’m probably being over dramatic again, but I can’t help it. I hurt my family, again, due to my negligence and dishonesty, and I may have effectively hurt the lives of two animals. Every time I mess up, I always try to piece together what led me to make such horrible choices. I don’t know how I became so broken that I can’t have stable relationships with people, or make choices that don’t end up hurting someone or something. Its getting to the point where I don’t even want to know the answer anymore, the answer that might’ve led me down the path to fixing myself. I just want it all to end, I’m tired of to trying to deny that I’m a horrible person, someone who doesn’t deserve to live. I know for a fact that if I just disappeared, so many people’s lives would be better for it. But right now, Deuce still depends on me, and I want at least help my mother with her current problem, which SHOULD be solved in the next few months. But after I’m no longer needed, I can’t see any real point in sticking around. Ever since I was a child, the idea of killing myself has been in my head, even before I became aware of the concept of suicide. I would look over bridges I’d walk over or be driven over, thinking what it be like if I just threw myself off. Would it be painful? Would I not have to deal with people anymore? Would I be missed? Being older now, I’m pretty sure I know the answers to the questions, yet, it still doesn’t me from those thoughts. I’m sorry to my family for being such a monster, I wish I could’ve known sooner how I should’ve acted, I wish I could’ve seen how my awfulness would’ve effected you in the years to come. You all are truly the most important people in my life, and I don’t want to hurt you. I’m sorry to Sophie and Sapphire, I wanted to give you a loving home, but do to my dishonesty, I was able to do that, I let you both down. Maybe if I had been honest in the beginning, you’d be home with me right now, and not with some stranger who I foolishly trusted to care for you. And to all the people who are or who tried to be my friends, I’m sorry to all of you for being so unbearable. You deserve a better friend than me, and if you chose to walk away from me now, I wouldn’t hold it against you at all, cuz I’d walk away from me too.",

Im wondering how long before I can return to my house without going to that bullshit place I'm fine. They showed up to my house and told my wife that am not going to be charged with any charges for breaking the law they would just try to take me back to the hospital and re-evaluate me with they stop looking after a week and it just be considering a missing persons report?

      "text": "Suicide is painless. I don’t know if anyone on here would even realize those are song lyrics, but they are. I’m mostly going to ramble, I’d highly suggest ignoring me.My husband accidentally killed himself on 6 September 2017. The term accidental suicide is a ‘funny’ one, but that’s what it was. Before that, everything was great. Suicide, for me, hasn’t been an option since I found out I was pregnant with my first daughter. And I found that out two months after a very long hospital and ICU stay after my last attempt. I wasn’t ready for a marriage, and sure as hell not a kid, two months after I almost died, but it’s what I got. And suicide hadn’t been an option since.Until now. And then it’s still not. My head is such a mess of a place, one minute I need to be here and take care of our kids and the next minute I need to be as far away from those girls so they have as good of life as possible. Preferably dead. But then I think about God (yes I’m spiritual, please don’t atheist at me and I won’t preach at you) and how if suicides really do go to hell then I can’t off myself on purpose and go be with my husband. But then, what if it doesn’t matter it was an accident and then he’s in hell anyway. I’d rather be down there with him, then again, it’s hell, so I doubt I’d be able to see him anyway. So then I have to do the what dreams may come route, get lucky, die randomly and hopefully painlessly, and then go save him. But I doubt it works like that either.Everyone talks about the dreams they have about their lost love ones, or his mom talks good things happening in her life. She said she was talking to him the other day about how she needed to mow her yard, but she was just too tired. The next day someone from the church called and asked if they could come do it for her. I haven’t had any of that. I haven’t had any dreams about you and I haven’t had any good that makes me feel like you care. I’ve had nothing. Why haven’t I had anything? Why don’t I matter at al.I totally realize I switched who I was talking to there, but I’m too lazy to go back and fix it all. And so then I don’t think about death, because why kill my self being upset about a guy who didn’t care about taking care of me or our two kids. And then I think about how if I’m so awful I couldn’t save their dad that night, then they probably don’t need me either. And they’d be better off. Thinking hurts. I wish there was a way we could turn our brains off and relax and breathe. I think there would be less death then.",

(Sorry if this post breaks any rules mods)A few month ago there was a post somewhere on reddit that was talking about what books are a necessity to read and was one of the top answers. All throughout the book are great ideas along with some very great quotes (\"So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\" was one of my favorites.) Each time I picked up the book and read a few paragraphs (I only read for a very short time, maybe fifteen minutes or one chapter if they're shorter at a time) I got a sense of calm happiness. One of the most amazing things about the book is that Frankl explains meaning while avoiding God (or gods) altogether. This is something which I rarely come across, whenever I'm in a deep conversation with my friends or family about meaning lots of the time God is brought up (and if I'm talking with an Atheist like myself they usually make it a point to bring up the non-existence of God and how it factors into their meaning.) I wouldn't hesitate to call Viktor's book life changing (not a grandiose life change but a change that has made me more sanguine, stoic, and calm in adverse situations.) What are some of your guy's thoughts on this book (or on the subject of meaning?)A few notes: The version I read was the 2006 edition with a foreword by Harold S. Kushner (neither the foreword nor the afterword were as amazing as the book but I still appreciated them).This is also one of the first books I read without it being mandatory; I got out of high school about two years ago never really read without needing to.",

      "text": "About Christopher Paolini's \"Eragon\" and it's criticism. (Spoilers for \"Eragon\" and it's sequels inside) I read the book Eragon when I was 14 and loved it, I wasn't really able to tell at the time, but it had something that really made it special to me. Fast forward some years and I have re-read the whole series more times that I can remember, and have a mostly free weekend, so I decide to check opinions and reviews online out of curiosity. What I find out is that the series was largely appreciated by many, but also received very harsh critics, so I want to explain why I don't share most of it. You are encouraged to disagree in the comments as long as you bring constructive criticism.I am calling the series (whose proper name is \"Inheritance Cycle\") \"Eragon series\" because more people know it by that name.I hope we can have a calm discussion about it, and this subreddit seems to be the best place, but if I'm breaking any rule (I think not), I will delete the post inmediately. There will be spoilers for the whole series, I hope the spoiler warning in the title is enough..ADVERTISINGI have read many people complain about how dissapointed they were by X review that put the series and Paolini on a pedestal, or how bad the movie adaptation was. And while I do agree that unreal expectations or shitty adaptations can affect ones first experience, I also think it is unfair to put all the blame on the original story, specially if we don't know how involved Paolini was in those, or to expect other people to have the same feelings.No I don't really mind there is a (in my opinion) terrible film adaptation, or that some columnist said Paolini was a visionary that was going to change literature at age 19. And while I don't believe that every piece of art should be judged only on it's own while ignoring the whole cultural landscape and the context in which it was created, for me, to completely ignore what the original material is and judge it only based on other's failures is going too far.This is an ongoing thrend and I despise it, just read the reactions to the new Jumanji film. People are saying how these \"uneccesary reimaginings\" are just catchgrabs that \"ruined their childhood\". Producers are often lazy and will go back to formulas that have worked in the past, but it's also true that these new versions are a way to bring those stories back to a younger audience, and the whole debate is fascinating, but none of this should be affecting the original movie and our love for it, or at least not this much..PAOLINI'S PROSEOne of the most common complains is that Paolini's writing is, simply put, bad, and while this is a good point, the problem comes when someone says that this alone is a reason to not read the series.I haven't read the original text's, because I read the spanish translation of the books, so the translator's might have made it better (although it doesn't seem likely).I never felt the writing was so bad that it stopped me from enjoying the story, he isn't a genius writer, but there are some pieces that will be stuck in my head forever:-The way he describes Shapira's egg as a blue diamond with tiny white veins, like a work of art that was polished to perfection.-The passage where they visit the \"rock forest\", with trees that where turned into stones by some sort of catastrophe.-The backstory of Durza and how its human host spiralled into madness until he made a deal that cursed him and the spirits forever, creating the tormented creatures that Shades are.-The whole visit to Vroengard, with the calamities of the rider war still corrupting life into forms that shouldn't be and scape our logic.And many more, his hyper detailed style makes every scene bloom with realism. And perhaps the word choice isn't the best, perhaps some of his metaphors suck, but he is deeply passionate about the story he is telling, and manages to communicate that. And this is something Paolini himself said in the books.In the second book, \"Eldest\", there is an elven festival called \"Agaetí Blödhren\", the thing is that every elf and visitor is expected to bring some piece of art or craftmanship. Eragon decides to write a poem about his adventures, and the experiences he's had. He writes it in the \"Ancient language\", which makes it impossible for the speaker to lie. And when he finishes, and shows the poem to his master, they have this conversation (I'm translating here so it won't be 100% accurate)-Clumsy, but honest.-Do you like it?-It's a good picture of your feelings, and the style hooks the reader, but it's no masterpiece. Did you expect it to be one?-I guess I didn't.-In any case, I'm surprised you managed to write it in this language. It is possible to write fiction and lie in the ancient language, but not to spoke those words later.-I can read it, because I honestly think it's true.-And that makes your writing much more powerfull... I'm impressed.I think Paolini was proyecting himself here, and as someone that as tried to create art, but doesn't have the technical skills to do so, I feel moved by that sentiment. I am not saying that writers shouldn't pay attention to their prose, or that good writing is meaningless, but art can be more than simply that, it's what makes it special.I have read many books that were technically excellent, authors that give new meanings to words I knew, and create sentences that show me other realities and worlds. I have read very few books that connected with me as an individual, stories I can relate with both at their best and at their worst..PLAGIARISM AND INSPIRATIONBy far, he most common criticism on the series, is that Paolini draws too many elements from other stories while adding close to nothing original. From LoTR he takes dragons, elves and dwarfs, from Earthsea the ancient language used by mages that describes things by their \"true name\" and allows to control the will of others. He takes significantly more from \"Star Wars\" (mainly the original film trilogy): the ancient order that was destroyed by an stray apprentice, the reveal that the main character's father was a villain, the old and disabled mentor... The list goes on, and there are other works of fiction in it.But before explain why I feel that's not fair criticism, I am going to do precisely that. I will take a character from Eragon and compare it to a character from Star Wars, and all the paralelism between both. The thing is, I am not taking a character from the Original Trilogy, but from the Sequel Trilogy (which came out AFTER Eragon). Let's compare Murtagh and Kylo Ren. Oh, just in case, SPOILERS from \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi\". They both:-have a past of abuse/neglect-are the heir's of an evil figure they try to emulate-are angry selfish assholes for the most part-are antagonists to the main character-reclaim the main character's sword, which was also used by the villain they look up to-kill a paternal figure of the main character-have an evil master that understimates them, and later rebel against them-have a romantic interest they want to protect and that causes such rebelionBut ultimately, none of that matters, because the most important thing about those characters is the point the creator is trying to make with them, the message they want to send to the reader/spectator. Murtagh is a character that decides to break the cycle of abuse after finding there are things he wants to protect instead of destroying. Kylo Ren is a monster because he actively wants to be seen as one to hide his inner weakness, and wants to burn anything that scares him. (I think the scene where he shouts \"MORE\" repeatedly was pretty explicit about that)I think that this is a case of inspiration rather than plagiarism, Paolini has stated once and again that he took ideas from previous authors, and mentioned the sources. And he manages to twist those concepts and give them a new meaning that made sense in the greater narrative of his story.For example, Brom isn't just some Obi-Wan rip-off because his relationship with Morzan had nothing to do with the one between Obi-Wan and Anakin, he was treated like a pet by someone he considered a friend, and had to find the strenght to fight the man he had looked up to his whole life. Him watching over Eragon as he grew is special because Brom was secretly his father (which was a second twist after the Morzan one), and felt responsible for him, so he admonishes Eragon more often as a result during his training.Every piece of art is partially inspired by previous work. Are we going to pretend the whole \"true name\" thing was invented by Le Guin, and that we've never heard of Rumpelstiltskin? That it doesn't have any parallels in Christian tradition? The Middle Earth was born from Tolkien's love of England and it's mithology. And it's no secret that George Lucas was inspired by samurai movies and eastern religions for Star Wars.The most imaginative world ever created is meaningless compared to a setting that talks about issues we can relate with. Fiction isn't scapism, it's a way to look at our world from a different perspective..DEUX EX MACHINAA deux ex machina is a plot device that is lazy or comes out of nowhere, and is used to solve a problem that seemed to be impossible to solve.There are many things in the series that people have labelled as such, but the two main ones are Eragon healing from his wounds in the end of the second book, and the spell he uses to defeat Galbatorix.The problem is, they both fit perfectly with the themes the story has been developing since the first page.The Inheritance Cycle talks about how people deal with scars (both physical and mental) and failure. Almost every named character has lived them, and the thing that draws the line between \"good\" and \"bad\" characters is how they deal with it. Nasuada and the \"Trial of the Long Knives\", Oromis and his disability, Glaedr's leg, Galbatorix and his first dragon, Murtagh's scar... The character's that accept those experiences and try to adapt to them are \"good\", the ones that have unhealthy reaction are \"bad\". The only exception being the Ra'Zac, who are \"bad\" because... reasons, also their whole species is evil and deserves to be erradicated (shrug).Leaving that apart, there is a whole chapter in \"Brisingr\" that is basically Eragon and Roran comparing their scars. Or the one in \"Eldest\" where Eragon has a discussion with Shapira, and she tells him to not give up on life just because of the pain.It's what Elva's whole character is about, suffering is an intrinsic part of life, but we can't allow it to define us. This is a series where one of the most powerful characters is a five year old child whose only real power is to understand others.That's why it doesn't feel \"out of nowhere\" for Eragon's back to heal after he has struggled with it and tried his best to continue his training despite his limitations.That's why greatest most evil wizard of all time isn't defeated in a sword duel or overpowered with magic energy, he is defeated with empathy. Eragon cannot win a one on one fight, he is outskilled in every possible way, and when he realices that he has lost, that all the training and fighting have not been enough, when he feels all the weight of his failure and that he can't save the people he loves, he wishes to share that with Galbatorix, he want's him to care for others.The all powerful tyrant literally goes down and starts sobbing because he can't handle the responsabilitiy of his own actions. To me, that is everything but \"cheap\". It is consistent. For Paolini, monsters are those that detach themselves from pain and refuse to be open about their feelings. I think that's a message worth spreading..SUMMARYI love Eragon. I love the whole series. It's a story that has spoken to me as a person and that has taught me things about myself I didn't knew, and I love it despite it's numerous flaws, to name a few: some cliches like the \"damsel in distress\" are overused without any depth to them, the writing can be lacking at times, some characters like the Ra'zac are treated and depicted very poorly, and under a ethically dangerous light.I think it's important to consider both the good and the bad when criticising, a book, a film, a play, you choose. We shouldn't let ourselves be blinded by hate nor fanatism, because it prevents us from talking about the inner workings of a story, the things that make them stand out. With Eragon, I feel the discourse was more leaned to the side of hate, and I think that we couldn't talk about the specific issues it has as a story, and even worse, it made people feel guilty for liking something and caring about it.One of the first reviews I read said that anyone who enjoyed the books should feel ashamed to call themselves a reader, and that they should go \"read some real fantasy\" like LoTR. I am not linking it here because I don't want to personally criticise someone for a two paragraph review they wrote a decade ago. But I can't think of a more toxic way to end that text, critics should give us a framework and lenses to look at art from their perspective, they should make us questions that we cannot make ourselves. Repeating the same point over and over without putting any real thought into its significance, jumping on a bandwagon to insult people who have a different opinion is the antithesis of that, and I feel that's what happened with Eragon. Perhaps I'm wrong.And that's it. Thanks for reading this far to some dude talking about a book series that ended seven years ago, if you think you have something meaningful to say about this mess of a text, I will appreciate your comment.",

I can't take this anymore.My chest hurts as I write this, I am on the brink of crying again (which I did a few hours ago - for about a half an hour/45 mins). I can't 'live in the moment' like everyone tells me to. I tell myself over and over again there's nothing to worry about right now. Everything is fine within this moment. Which is counseling I've given people before (yes. I used to be a counselor). I've saved at least one life in the 5 1/2 years I worked in the field (suicide prevention/substance abuse). But evidently I can't help myself.I just want to sleep, but I can't. I just want to stay home from work, but I can't. I just want to go hiking on the trails near my apartment, but I can't. I just want to draw, but I can't. Nothing is making me happy, everything is just dragging me right back into anxiety again. It's never been this bad before.

I have depression, but it doesn't excuse my actions. Truth is I haven't really been honest with you all. There was another reason we broke up.I gave my ex herpes in 2016. We didn't have sex for a long time and it got frustrating. Things came to a head in May 2017 when I started getting pushy because she wouldn't sleep with me. She said it hurt too much. It wasn't about the physical aspect of it for me, it was about the emotional intimacy we had together. It wasn't about getting off for me.I just read our old Facebook messages and I now see how pushy I actually was. I really didn't think I was that bad, I'd never normally do something like that and I don't even know what I was thinking. I'm such a piece of shit. All this time I've been hoping she'll come back to me and I've held off killing myself for that reason, but now it just feels like I should just do it to free myself of the guilt I feel. Or maybe I deserve to feel this guilt. Either way I think the world would be better off without me. It doesn't need someone like me in it when there's good people dying every single fucking day. It hardly seems fair.I have truly destroyed her. I saw pictures and quotes she put up on messenger that made me realise she really did care about me at one point, but I ruined it. The best thing for me is a hole in the ground. It's all so pointless without her. But I'm the reason we broke up. I'm the reason she hates me. And I hate myself more and more because of it.I was gonna wait until New Years Eve just to see if she'll come back to me but I don't think I'll make it until the weekend now.",

I'm not saying I'm a special snowflake because I know most of you on this sub go through worse stuff than me. I know nobody asked for this, so I don't really want to be a whiny brat, but I've honestly had enough. I'm a shitty person. I don't reply to messages from people who are still actually trying to talk to me because it all seems pointless to me. I leave my bed only if it's absolutely necessary, and I hate spending time with others no matter how important those people are to me. I used to love art, but I can't bring myself to create things anymore. At the beginning of summer break I was like, \"I'm going to draw every single day for the following two months, so I can form a habit I'd like to maintain and work hard on becoming an artist.\" Well, guess what. Summer break's ending today, and I only sketched once, and it ended up being a piece of garbage. I realized if I actually wanted to be an artist, I'd be passionate and wouldn't know how to live without constantly making art, and that's the exact opposite of me. I usually ended up hating my artwork anyways, so I think there are people much more determined to become artists, and they sure as hell deserve it more than someone like myself. I'm just pretty much numb most of the time, but whenever a tiny inconvenience creeps into my life, my brain instantly goes to 'suicidal mode'. Crippling anxiety takes over me, and my life goes from 0 to -10. The only thing I can think about is death. I use it as a coping mechanism 'Nothing I do matters because we will all die anyways' to make my anxiety less extreme, but it's not very healthy since I start planning my own suicide. I'm changing schools and I'll be in a completely new environment, which makes things even worse because I can't stop imagining the worst scenarios. Basically, right now the best option I have is hanging myself. I messed up everything in my life. I failed my driving exam on my birthday, I couldn't take the pressure at my previous school and I can't keep making art. I honestly don't have any dreams or a future. The only thing I genuinely want is peace.(Please do not suggest therapy/medication. I can't get any professional help right now.)",

That they don't scream at themselves to stop feeling the way that they do?Here, it is safe and we \"meet them where they are\" we join them in their despair, even with the knowledge that we may not be able to \"make anything better\" but offering that space and time, may be the one thing that is needed and that nobody else has ever done for them.It is in fact a very precious thing to be able to offer yourself, to just \"be\" with somebody else and fully present to them.Amy",

So this whole mess began just 4 days ago when he called the suicide hotline and they had an ambulance bring him to a hospital for an evaluation. They let him out the same day and gave him a note to take the day off from work. The very next day he called my mother saying he was ready to go and he was done with life. He told her he would jump in front of a car. I called him as my mom headed over to see him in person and I kept his attention on the phone until my father made it to his apartment. My parents had a long talk with him and he worked out a plan, including a dr visit and therapy, to start fixing some of the issues that have lead to this and he promised to check in with my mother twice a day to let her know he's doing alright. Everything was looking fine until tonight he snapchatted my brother a picture of 9 xanax and his alcohol and turned his phone off. With no way to get in touch, my brother who lives a bit closer (25 minutes) drove to his apartment and called the police who said to call them back when he gets there if he doesn't answer. Well thankfully he did answer his door but despite everything he tried, my brother refused to give him the pills and told him to leave or he would call the police because he's trespassing. So with his phone off, we have no idea if he's alive at this point or not. He has told us to not call 911 or any emergency services or he would kill himself for sure when he gets back to his place. We are left in a situation where he refuses any help, and has caused the whole family to be worrying 24/7 while there is nothing we are able to do. Is there anything someone out there can think of that we can do? Or do we sit around until he makes good on his threats? Only idea I have after reading a bit online is involuntary commitment but I fear that would make the situation worse if it even worked out. He has no history of suicide or any attempts so they would probably send him on his way.",

      "text": "More drama and commotion Ok so I've been suicidal for over 2 years. I wasn't exactly serious about attempting suicide and I don't want to die but I got desperate enough looking for some sort of cure. I mean my situation was a recipe for disaster and sooner or later I was going to do something stupid. One day I just snap, I saw it coming. I planned suicide twice before both in October. This was barely planned, I simply decided in school that I'm going to leave a lesson early and collect my antidepressants to do some fucking lame ass overdose that wouldn't kill me but what do you do when you're a 17 year old kid who's suicidal thoughts just get increasing worse. I don't fucking no, this inpatient thing my help so why the fuck not? I got home realised that was lame, shoved a belt in a door and tried to half ass-ly hang myself and well it didn't really work. I came out unharmed completely basically, it was more like \"OMFG I JUST TRIED TO HAMG MYSELF WTF\". So I ring my friend telling her that I sorta tried to hang myself and feel like I'm going to do something stupid. I basically start walking myself to the hospital before I swallow all these 28 antidepressants in my bag which was incredibly tempting or I would do some other God forsaken crap because fuck life I don't know. In the end she negotiates that I should call 999. I perch myself up against some sort of electricity box on some random street and wait for the ambulance that was due within 2 hours. In the end a paramedic rings me, by that time I've calmed down a bit, promised her I wouldn't hurt myself tonight and went to meet my friends who I had previously also rang about what I had done. The paramedic arranged a guy from a crisis team to call me. He did. He said someone will call me tomorrow after school to arrange to see me for an assessment (today by the time I write this it's like 4am because I can't sleep). I give him my mum's number because he wants in, I desperately don't want him to call my parents, he said he will negotiate it but it may be necessary. What did he fucking do? Ring my mum ASAP who rang me screaming at me. Nice. (This part was during youth group btw). So I go home after youthy, I don't get confronted as much as I thought I would. I end up throwing up 4 times before I go to bed because I'm just so overwhelmed with emotions (my body is somehow annoyingly really good at this. I'm sure 90% of the reasons that I throw up in general are probably purely psychological... Thanks brain...)The aftermath is way worse than the amount of distress I felt during those few hours where I mostly just completely lost my damn mind and freaked out. I didn't even feel that bad I was kinda like \"I really really want to fucking do this and I don't even understand the motivation behind it\". I have been waking up every hour, no matter how much I try to stop it I cannot stop thinking about what happened and what will go on from here. Yesterday wasn't the worst day of my life, today will surely be. Hindsight bias makes me completely regret what I did but I knew it was coming. Like I said sooner or later I would do something I would regret and very likely be alive for the aftermath of. So today I have to go to school like nothing happened, God forbid my family makes any interaction with me in the morning. Make up some bullshit excuse as to why I missed the last lesson and why my English homework isn't done. I'll probably either say \"Oh no, I completely forgot omg\" or \"Sorry something personal came up\". Apparently I have a counselling appointment tomorrow which I'm sure my mum wrongly informed me about but I'm sure some guy from that service will simply ring me to make an appointment. Yada yada yada some more Bullcrap that I'm dreading aka the full day and the days to come blah blah blah. Oh yeah I wonder when my dad finds out about this... Attempts lame ass suicide out of desperation and gets afraid of doing something stupid afterwards. Almost gets picked up in an ambulance and parents find out that I'm suicidal. I realise that the aftermath is a lot worse than what I expected. Or more of a \"Ok whatever happens after this will be whatever\" and when the aftermath actually comes up I'm like \"Yeah no I can't do this.\"",

      "text": "Yes I've watched too much Duggars - and embarrassed myself in front of my colleagues. Last week I was at a first aid course with about 70 of my work colleagues. The instructor was explaining what type of medical conditions require an emergency call and those that do not. He gave the example of febrile convulsions, which are quite common in young children who have a sudden raise in temperature. Of course that reminded me of Josie Duggar. So I was thinking of that when he went on explain further about it and how usually you don't need to call an ambulance if you know that child suffers from them or if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes or, obviously, if the child stops breathing. I was nodding along like I knew exactly what he was talking about (I don't! Only know about it because of Josie).He then asked the group to raise your hand if your child has ever suffered from febrile convulsions and stupidly - because I was lost in thought remembering that episode about Josie - I raised my hand! I got a few quizzical looks because everybody knows I don't have any children. Fortunately, several other of my colleagues raised their hand too. Unfortunately, the instructor asked me to share my experience....\"Um...er....well....she wasn't my kid...\" <shifting uncomfortably in my seat> \"She uh, was a....friend's child. Well, not a friend as such, and not her child, but rather her young sister.\"Instructor: \"Tell us about her seizures.\"\"Oh well! So she was running around like crazy and had been recovering from a cold....\"Instructor interjects to explain more about you need to be careful with children who have had a virus, to keep them calm and keep their fluids up. Referring back to me, he asks: \"Did your friend call the ambulance?\"\"She did yes because she was panicking as her parents weren't home. I don't think they took her to the hospital though.\" Thank god he took over from there.But holey dooley I think I think about this family waaaaay too much!",

English is not my mother tongue and I ain't no smart either.I don't know if I'll succeed this time. But I think I will. It will be painful but I promise myself the pain will only last for few seconds then there will be peace, endless peace. At least for me. I don't know if its against the rules to post gruesome details of how will I do it but yes, I'll jump on raging traffic and place my head under a ten-wheeler truck. I just can't find any other way; a gun is way too expensive and I find jumping off a bridge, from a building or by hanging being too cliche. I don't want to be an inconvenience to the public but getting my head crushed is the easiest I could find. At least it will guarantee my death. Enough with how I plan to end it but this is my story.I'll save you my personal information but so long as I can remember, I've been depressed and suicidal for 7 years; 6 and half to be precise since I wouldn't be here in October in anyway. I started to develop depression after I was kicked out in the Seminary. I was in Highschool Seminary and I've always wanted to serve God and become a priest but alas, I was in High School. I bullied and got bullied, it's a common standard. Albeit I befriended myself (I was on Junior High) with a Freshman. He has no friends whatsoever since he was not friendly to anybody. I can't exactly remember what started our feud but I bullied him since for his ungratefulness; I was his only friend yet he does not treat me so kindly. I can't remember how we reconciled and became friends again later on. I don't know if it was part of his master plan but since I was in High School (and a virgin), we begun perversely mocking our teachers especially our librarian. There I made an indecent letter addressed to our librarian to allow me to have sex with her, signed with a forged signature of our monsignor. He took the letter and reported me; to which I beat him up for. Few days later, the council had a meeting and decided to not allow me to enroll in the seminary for the following year. I was devastated. I pleaded badly. I sent letters to the Seminary formators and the Archbishop himself and found out the prick made a story that I had an affair with him, making my situation worse. Didn't realize I will never recover from this.Then begun my trust issues. I graduated High School in a different school with less friends than I had before. I went to College and found new friends but my trust issues later kicked in and I transferred to another school. This time, it was worse. My anxiety and trust issues were so severe I was unable to make any friends, none whatsoever. I'm in a four-year course and sadly, I'm on my sixth year now due to failing grades and tons of no-grade status. I took same courses consistently for 2 semesters while barely hanging by a thread. I had two probations, and it took me 5 semesters to finish 2 semester- CWTS/ROTC. I went 6 years in college with literally no friends. I eat alone, everyday somewhere far where nobody would recognize me. I don't hang out with anyone nor I can't remember having any decent conversation with anybody. I always find a way to avoid people even to the point of punishing myself for them to avoid me. The anxiety was so severe, I purposely don't brush my teeth nor apply deodorant just so people would avoid me. Albeit that didn't stop them from inviting me to fraternities which I politely refuse. You see, I get easily irritated like every depressed people. I may not look like one but I'm freakishly strong; probably because of pent up anger within me. I often try to channel my frustration through boxing and picking fights but that doesn't seem to satisfy me. Sex also doesn't soothe me. It's a temporary pleasure but it doesn't help me in a long-shot. I even thought I was homosexual since girls doesn't seem to satisfy me but the thought of having sex with another guy disgusts me. Never went down that road but I'm pretty sure I'm straight. Anyway, the only courses left for me next semester are seminars and On the-Job-Trainings to which I fear I won't succeed. I've never made any friends in college and envy my sister for living the life I wish I had. I love my family, I really do. This is why I've survived 7 years of suicidal depression just for them. I've hurt them before, both mentally and physically (thrice: hit my sister twice and boxed with my father which I clearly lost). I'm not proud of it, I can't control myself but they love me still. They didn't realize my condition until last year where it had gone so severe that I was barely about to hide it. I started banging my head against a wall until I pass out about 3 years ago. Every morning I cry myself out on how I was still alive, hoping I wasn't able to wake up. Every night I hope will be my last. But it never came. I tried-to many to count stupid, menial suicide attempts. I've strangled myself with a blanket, drowned myself in a pail, bought sleeping pills from the black market but all of that, I was able to resist. My body somehow instinctively survives and resists them. I remember passing out after I strangled myself with a blanket and woke up with my arms unwrapping them. I remember waking and coughing up blood in the bathroom after trying to drown myself. I remember my hair went crazy after I showered and stuck my fingers on the socket without my hands being burnt to crisps. I remember waking up after continuously banging my head on the concrete wall on my room with blood everywhere and surviving. I've always find a way for my family not to notice it. I'm quick to work on cleaning the blood stains and covering what happened. I don't want them to see any physical attempts of suicide. I even bought a neck bracer to hide the ruffs on my neck.Then I begun hearing voices. I know it's me but it feels like someone else. It wanted me to kill my family whom I loved dear. The voices were overwhelming I begun banging my head in-front of my family hoping it would stop. It concerned them so bad. Several weeks later, they overheard me singing some kind of suicide song, dizzy from continuous head banging. Later at the end of that semester, they sent me to rehab. They conspired with a psychiatrist to which I revealed everything. They drugged me, kidnapped me and had my ass on rehab. It didn't help. Rehab feels like a deterrent instead of a recovery. I stayed for a month in the facility and deterred any physical manifestations of my suicidal tendencies after I got out. I no longer bang my head on a concrete wall, I just punch the shit out of it. I boxed, so I know where to hit it.I learned from my psychiatrist I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder with extreme suicidal tendencies. Coupled with social anxiety, agora phobia, severe trust issues, anti-social personality disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and PTSD. PTSD not from a life-threatening situation but PTSD from getting kicked out of the seminary. I've met all the conditions except the first requirement.I don't want to leave my family but if I continue to live my life, I might end up doing something I regret. I don't want to hurt my family nor anyone else ever again. I'm doing myself a favor. No one is going to love someone like me. I'll save my future children some problems, I don't want them to inherent my depression. I forgot to mention I'm no longer religious. I never had God with me nor felt any divine presence ever since I acquired depression. I was all alone. Despite the family support and help, I still feel alone. And I would rather die alone. If this was karma for all the wrongs I've did, I believe this is too excessive of a punishment. If there is a good God, I don't know why my depression is part of his plan or anything. If there is hell, well, I rather be there instead of being here. I just hope they can never uncover my plan. I'm tired guys. I really am. It's selfish to commit suicide but I don't think I'll be any of good use in the future. I'll be an inconvenience. Depression made me stone-cold. I had crushes but I never felt love. Sex wasn't love, it was fun. What's sad is the only thing that keeps me alive today and wanting to live for the following years are TV-shows and movies. That's all. Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Lucifer, DBZ super, Avengers, Justice League, etc. I've watch too many shows and movies alone. The only imaginry friends I had were TBBT, HIMYM and FRIENDS. But I think none of that will matter. I won't remember anything of that when I'm dead anyway.2 week countdown from now. I'll wait for the semester to end. I'll die with fashion, wearing my favorite jeans, shoes and shirt. I'll be busy preparing my death, farewell letters and stuff. Plus, I major in Psychology. At least it will send a signal to my batchmates to start helping depressed individuals. Goodbye Reddit. I know nobody or few would bother to read this but still. Bye!",

I've had mental health issues for twenty one years now and it works in a cycle. For a few months I'm alright, just low grade sadness and anxiety, but I can get through my day and enjoy life. Then it hits and I don't like food, I'm not hungry, and most of my resources go to fighting intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. In the first stage I fight those thoughts by pointing out that I shouldn't hurt myself. In the second stage once the first one fails, I argue against the methods as they are not practical or would not work. In the third I focus on my family and the way it may hurt them. If the third stage ever fails, I will probably be dead. It lasts from days, to weeks usually until I'm out of the pit and back on steady ground.Problem is, I don't want to keep fighting this cycle. I don't want to screw around with medication until I find the right dosage. I don't want people who don't know the extent of this problem to judge me or decide what's best for me either.Example: I discovered two puffs of devil's lettuce wakes some part of myself back up. I stopped crying around 10 or 11, and now at 29 I cry maybe once a year or less. Not for lack of trying, just... I can't cry more than a few tears. I also don't have many urges to protect myself or fight back. But two puffs and suddenly I could sit and cry for a half hour with tears. Suddenly I don't want to be snapped at and abused, so I reflect it back on people who try. Husband was ecstatic because he 'had his wife' finally, instead of brief glimpses of me.But a co-worker? They decided that the smoke caused panic attacks. And no, I didn't smoke at work. Only at home, and I washed well, but they said I was causing an allergic reaction in them. So quit or get a random drug test. Same person who says I can't have Bipolar II because in the two years I've worked there, they've never seen a manic episode in me. Nevermind the month or more I stopped sleeping in Junior High.She and the Boss know what's best so no more smoke, go get more pills and hope for the best.That was Monday. Since then I've taken a lot of my medicine. I had something that helped. I don't want to fight anymore. But it doesn't do much. Trouble breathing, heart feels off, muscles keep spasming or arm twitches. Eyes dilated. It's uncomfortable and even painful, but it's been three days.I just don't want to fight anymore.",

      "text": "What Horror movies could have been extremely thought provoking if they didn’t screw it up in the last fifteen minutes? Watched Lights Out the other night and, as the child of someone with mental illness, was riveted by the way Diana the depression ghost exemplified some of the difficulties of mental illness—wanting and not wanting to get better, driving off members of the family, children who only kind of get what’s going on, etc. The daughter trying to save the son and literal fighting her mother’s demons while managing her own anxieties about commitment was so great—until the “solution” was for the Mom to commit suicide. What? This is like the worst possible ending for this complex treatment. I read after on Wikipedia that the director was horrified that some depressed people were attempting suicide because of the movie’s conclusion—more horrified because he (like many of us Scandies) struggles with depression himself. It reminded me also of The Last Exorcism, which played on many of the cultural stereotypes of the South and of Evangelical preachers that it felt kind of healing to watch this scumbag faker encounter a power far beyond his own smug deceptions. It was also on track to be one of, like, three good found-footage movies. Then there had to be literal Satan worship and the stupid Murder of the whole crew and all I could think of was “Who edited this? And why didn’t they edit the dizzying last sections?” When those angry thoughts cleared, I also wondered what happened to the undercurrents of how rural southerners can have dignity beyond what manipulative hucksters think of them. So now I’m thinking—what other horror movies come close to greatness only to fall about in the denouement? Edit: typos",

      "text": "I'm a suicidal medical student (sorry this is a bit long) Hi... So I recently tried to quit medical school on the very last year. We started doing actual work in the hospital, interacting with real patients, doing 29 hour shifts. I broke down the first day and tried to quit. That's when things went downhill.My family thought I was just taking a short break, but when I told them clearly that I'm not going back, they started attacking me. They started saying how my happiness isn't important. That this is the real world and I needed to be a doctor to have a good, easy income, regardless of whether I'm happy or not. Then they would talk about how I was too spoiled, and that was the reason I couldn't handle a 29 hour shift. If it were them, they would've been able to finish medical school. And they were gonna be more strict now so I wouldn't be spoiled anymore.We went on a family vacation a month later and they just kept harassing me. Every little mistake I made, every stupid thing I did, they would point it out and tell everyone. The parents that were so supportive of me all these years, turns out they had just been lying because I was gonna be that \"perfect doctor son\". I then planned my suicide during the trip.I got home and was ready to act out my suicide, but the method I was gonna use was gone and I was at a loss of what to do. I felt worthless and I wanted out. I wanted the harassment to stop. So I went back to Medical school. Maybe my parents were right and I had to just suck it up and stop whining. It's been almost 2 weeks and I haven't gone a day without wanting to cry for hours in the hospital bathroom. Im very bad at all the practical skills and I'm just not physically strong enough. At least I'm away from my parents and the harassment stopped. They went back to their usual facade of being supportive parents. But the work is tough and my health has been deteriorating from the 29 hour shifts. Yes other people can do it, but I know I can't. And I keep having thoughts of killing myself in the hospital. So no matter what I do, I just wanna die.Life is good. It's actually great to be alive and to experience everything in the world. I'm just not good enough to be alive here. Not good enough to pay the price for living. I joined this subreddit, hoping to tell people that life can be good, that something good might come out of my hypocrisy and I might help people. Now I just wanna let it all out.",

This was the 2nd time that we fought majorly and that we went apart. Last time, he forgave me and I wrote a sincere apology to him on Steam. We would always talk on Discord. I keep fucking up I think I am a dangerous person, but idk. I am shy and anxious, just like he is. We share many similarities and interesting things. I couldn't get over what happened in the past, and I got mad at him for calling me out to be a hypocrite in which I was, that I had \"quit \" a game, when I said that person said he did but didn't. I admit I was a major hypocrite I was told that he couldn't sleep and had panic attacks, poor health and cared for me by my other best friend whos also close friends with him. I know he goes on this forums website. What should I say and do this time to fix it? I also was thinking about taking an online break before we even fought. I wish I could fix it, what can I do? I have thoughts of deleting and killing myself because he cared for me and I cared for each other. I drove him away all because of the past, I mentioned the past when I mentioned about this guy who I kept talking about and he got annoyed with it. We had this special friendship and I ruined it again. I have lied to him, and I don't expect him to forgive me right away. I was thinking \"I'm sorry for being mad at him, it's my fault and I accept blame for what I've done. Even if I am upset, I should not take it on someone who cares about me and worries. I have felt the same for you. I hope I still have a chance and don't expect instant forgiveness right away.\" I just want to end it all this is killing me because I could have prevented it if I could just fix my fucking attitude. I act like the world is revolving around me and I wanna stop being woe is me it is so annoying. I want to stop fucking acting like this and own up to my mistakes. He loses sleep because he's worried about me. He panics about me. He's always hoping that I am okay and I treated him like shit. I want to treat him fairly well, I am horrible I am so fucking selfish and foolish for doing that. I wanna fucking kill myself for this, I don't wanna keep repeating the same mistakes again. The 2nd time this had happened, I can understand why he's pissed off. I wish I was a better friend, he has treated me well and I been horrible recently. I was thinking about taking a break from the online stuff before doing this. I can't sleep thinking about how much pain he has, I want to deal with it. I guess I just don't know how to approach it in a more firm manner and he is usually a patient person. Yeah I really fucked up again that it's becoming a game. I can't keep doing this same shit again, and he said he couldn't do this anymore. I do feel horrible but I deserve the blame honestly. I want to cut myself and hit myself for being an asshole.",

      "text": "44 years old and I can't handle aging So I'm vain. I used to be very pretty and now I see my body changing and it depresses me so much. I don't have a job so it's not like I can make money to change my body back to its former glory. I could try exercising and dieting but again you need money to eat right. I do walk 8000 to 10000 steps a day but it hasn't done anything for my body. I've had a good life though. I opened a successful boutique which then went under due to long term street construction. I did well as a model and even as a vet assistant. I play violin and draw better than average but not so well that I can make a career out of my talents--believe me, I've tried. I can't hold down a vanilla job and have been fired so many times due to my lack of people skills. I really have a hard time with authority figures and corporate politics. I just can't play the game to get ahead. I've had so many traumatic jobs where my boss would either verbally or sexually harass me, or sabotage and steal my work. I'm just tired and I feel guilty for living and making my husband support me. I never chose to be born and I have no idea why I was even brought into this world. I've always felt bewildered by human beings and life in general. I just want to leave my aging physical body and not have to worry about superficial material things anymore. I can't stand the fact that I have to tolerate a job to make money to live out my days aging. I've tried so many diets and body hacks to change my body. Nothing works. In fact, any real hardcore exercise makes me gain weight because my adrenals are so worn out. I went temporarily blind on a raw vegan diet. I don't know how some women can stay so beautiful and young looking. Their techniques just don't work on me. Part of me wants to fight this voice that lulls me into committing suicide. Part of me says there are ways to change my body and that God wouldn't give me this body to hate it. There is a way for me to make some kind of supportive income so I don't have to rely on my husband. Hope is so seductive. Maybe I can find a way to fix this life and somehow enjoy it again. Wouldn't that be nice? Thanks for reading this. I appreciate your time. I hope you're not considering ending your physical existence. There must be a reason we are encouraged to live our lives out as fully as we can, there must be a reason why suffering happens. The tiredness has to stop because I choose to make it go away. Life really is dictated by our thoughts. So the more I wallow in this misery the more I create it. That's how it works and it sucks because it's really easy for me to just surrender to the misery and live in the pit. It feels so familiar to be miserable because I could blame my father for beating me as a kid. I could give into the misery of surviving several sexual assaults when I was a little girl. No one would question why I decided to end my life. I won't kill myself today because I decided to hang on to the hope that I can change my body for the better and find a way to make a decent income. It's out of curiosity to see how my life will turn out. I can always kill myself if it gets really bad. I always have that choice.",

And if by any chance, this post breaks the rules, I apologize. With that said, on to my post we go. For starters, I haven't been able to eat all that well these past few days and have gotten quite ill because of that. I actually felt okay during the initial days of my sickness. What I mean is that I didn't actively plan my death as much. I wouldn't mistake that for being happy though. I think it was just the fact that I was too unwell to even get out of bed and I was focusing on being sick.Anyway, I feel as though I need to go through with it today. Does a person typically leave a reason in their note? Well, it's a bit more complicated than that for me. There's not exactly one reason to why I've decided to kill myself, but I will say that each and every reason is my own fault. No one else's. Nope, it's all my own. However, I will say that when I do die, everything will inherently be so much better for all of my family/pets. No more living off of their hard earned funds and under their safety of their home. No more destroying them with my intolerable and disgusting ways of living. I'm a slob and I mean a true slob. I'm rather unintelligent and unattractive. Short and stubby, overweight, and unimportant perfectly describe me. My own mother didn't want to have me as a child because of all of my faults... I can't say I blame her though. I'm just progressively destroying every relationship with anyone I've ever been close to. I'm so sorry. I've come to decide that killing myself is truthfully my only option. I won't go to therapy as there really isn't anything wrong with me. I'm looking at it from a logical standpoint... Everyone really is better off without me and I shouldn't burden them with my continued existence. I'm younger, I'll admit, but I'm still legally an adult and in the end, it's my choice. This is my only choice. I can't change, I fail every time. Either I'm unbelievably lazy or I simply just can't change. I know I've tried though, but as of late, I've given up. So, I'm going to hang myself. Not this exact moment as I need to relax. I feel like my heart is beating right out of my chest, whether it be from me being sick or not, it's not a nice feeling. Once the feeling subsides, I'm going to go through with my plan. It'll be today though, I'm confident in that. It has to be today. No matter whether I want to die or not. I have to.To all of my family and pets, thank you for everything you've all done for me. I know that I was horrible and I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know that at first, my death won't be easy, but time will pass and you'll see how much better it is for all of you. Even if you can't see it, trust me... It's better. I can't express this enough, everything that's happened isn't your fault and it'll never be your fault. I am so sorry... So sorry. I love you all endlessly. Please forgive me.",

      "text": "Hi I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go.Very long post ahead. Advanced sorry for the shitty formatting.So I'm currently with a girl (we havent been together for long) and this is the happiest time of my life so far. I'm dead set on making this work. At the beginning I thought that if this fails, I'll never go for a relationship again but it turned into something worse. I'd literally choose her over everything. Every outcome I aim for is literally for our relationship and time together(or so i'd like to think) .I was a bit depressed and a bit suicidal before we got together. Just a bit. No actual acts involved. Though I was thinking very hard to go to a therapist because I felt I was going down that sad inevitable path.Now I realized that I became fully dependent to her. There were times we came close to a breakup and my thoughts were only zeroing in to suicide. Like there was never another option but that.She's nice but sometimes she'd like to mess with me (not very serious) but sometimes because of anxiety and trust issues I'd take it seriously but she still won't stop. (for instance I asked who's this guy then she'd answer in a manner that'd make anyone think there's something between the lines).Sometimes it leads to an endless cycle of fight that would end up with me apologizing like I'm begging for my life. Because I probably am.A hint of cheating(although unlikely) from her would also give me attacks of \"those\" thoughts. And it' d be enough to keep me wide awake until it gets resolved somehow. We havent fought for a time now. And I'm desperately fighting to keep it this way and fortunately there hasnt been anything weird hsppening lately but it's inevitable. I just want to make sure that I'll make it through next time. With her fortunately. In my current state, I probably wont last 3 weeks without talking to her. I'd be dead by the end of the 2nd week. I'm wish I am joking but I have enough anger and sadness to push myself from a high place when I'm at a really bad place. (almost seriously did it once. Stood on top of a footbridge for almost two and a half hours. The only thing that kept my feet on the ground was the fact that she hadn't broken up with me yet but was very close to doing so) Everything my life is depends on this relationship right now. I have a lot of hobbies but nothing makes anything work in me when we're fighting. Even the things I love the most turns into nothing when we're fighting. I'm paralyzed. So basically, I want to be less dependent. For the sake of both of us. Having someone commit suicide because of you is kind of traumatic(at least for me).If she ever breaks up with me, i want to last a bit longer than two weeks. She may get convinced that she's not the reason or something. I dont know. Im a mess. I dont even have a reason for writing this right now. I just think I should. Having to live without her is something I can never do at this point. This is the cringiest thing ive ever written but I have no other way of asking for help.",

I never eat and am constantly high because all i do is work so, fuck it might as well get high any chance i can get. Whats shitter is I'm to scared of pain to do anything, so i just cry and beg to die.",

      "text": "Wrestling Observer Rewind ★ Jul. 28, 1997 . The plan is to do a live Raw, followed by a taped Raw the next day on Tuesday which would then air on the following Monday. It's being done as a cost-cutting measure. Live tapings each week were killing them and they weren't seeing any significant ratings difference from the old taped Raws. In fact, WWF seems very concerned over the financial situation of the company lately and have been cutting costs in other ways, such as flying less people in to shows, booking cheaper flights on lower-cost days, and changing the house show schedule in ways to cut back on travel costs. and all future PPVs will be monthly and all carry the same $29.95 price. This is also pretty much a money decision. WCW has been running PPVs in that price range and are still doing higher buyrates, so WWF finally realized that they could raise the price and people will still buy the shows (this trend continued for years. WWF incrementally raises the price, people keep buying. 10 years later, PPVs were $60 instead of $30 and we all just kept handing over our money like idiots). Meanwhile, Wrestlemania will still be a little bit more expensive to preserve the \"specialness\" of that event. In fact, throughout the business, it's beginning to look like price doesn't matter up to a certain point. Zane Bresloff who promotes house shows for WCW has gradually been increasing ticket prices across the board and in some cases, it's actually shown a significant increase in ticket buys. It's believed that fans see lower prices as something cheap and minor league, but higher prices make it seem more special and therefore attractive to buyers. Obviously, there's a ceiling where the price would be too high, but so far, wrestling hasn't reached it yet.. The show did way bigger ratings than WCW usually does in that time slot, so TNT is thrilled about it. As for Raw, without competition from Nitro, they did one of their highest ratings in years. Interestingly enough, the Raw rating drew about 70% of the usual combined audience for both shows, which means there's 30% of fans who would rather not watch wrestling at all on Monday night if Nitro isn't on. Nitro was bumped to Tuesday night this week but no word on how the ratings were yet. In the future, WCW plans to start airing monthly-ish 3-hour Nitros on a semi-regular schedule, but not every week. Basically, sometimes it'll be 2 hours, sometimes it'll be 3.. Paul Heyman claims Raven's ECW contract had a non-compete clause which prevented him from appearing on any other company's PPV for 6 months but WCW put him on PPV anyway. Heyman also says that WCW attempted to use Raven as an intermediary to try to get Sandman to come to WCW, which Heyman claims is contract tampering. In the case of Stevie Richards, Heyman claims Richards signed a letter of intent to negotiate a new deal with ECW when he suddenly showed up in WCW. Richards admits signing the letter, but believes the time period on it had run out and that he was free to leave, but Heyman disputes that. Heyman claims he released Richards from the deal because Richards had informed him that he would no longer be able to wrestle due to his neck injury, and then Richards immediately went to WCW. The contract situation isn't the legal problem though. ECW is claiming they own the intellectual rights to the Raven and Stevie Richards characters and that WCW using their same ECW gimmicks violates ECW's copyright (basically the TNA/Matt Hardy situation). Dave talks about how WCW has run into this issue before, when Ray Traylor debuted in WCW doing the same look and gimmick of his Big Boss Man character and WWF threw a fit, so WCW changed it. Raven maintains that he created the Raven character and he has the rights to it.. Dave breaks down the history of this on-again-off-again fight and basically says Takada is a great professional wrestler and has a lot of kickboxing training, but he's still a pro wrestler who's never been tested in a real fight and Dave thinks he doesn't really stand a chance against Gracie (he was correct). This ends up being the first ever Pride event.: PPV buyrates, live attendance, TV ratings, etc. TL;DR - WWF is doing the best live business they've done in years, but PPV buyrates and TV ratings are down. As for WCW, pretty much everything is up but you can't give all the credit to the NWO angle. In fact, WCW's PPV buyrates in 1997 so far are actually lower than the 1995 buyrates. And TV ratings are actually down slightly from the same time period in 1996 (which was before the NWO debuted) so once again, despite being a hot angle, the NWO hasn't really made any significant impact on TV or PPV numbers. They do seem to be responsible for the increased house show and merchandise numbers though. in a match last week but he still plans to work the upcoming G-1 tournament.. ECW, UFC, K-1, Michinoku Pro, and Pancrase all debuted in that year and in their own way, they all changed the face of the wrestling/fighting industry. due to so many top stars being gone. Super Delfin and Shiryu quit, Taka Michinoku headed to WWF, Jinsei Shinzaki jumping ship to AJPW, and top star Great Sasuke taking a leave of absence to work in WWF as well. Speaking of Sasuke, that WWF deal may be falling apart. Sasuke held a press conference in Japan this week and was upset about WWF flying him from Japan to the U.S. with an economy class ticket and said he felt like WWF doesn't respect how big a star he is. He was also upset because WWF flew Taka Michinoku in from Mexico on first class, when Taka is nowhere near his star power. So who knows. and it doesn't look like there are any plans to bring him up to WWF anytime soon so it doesn't look like Jacobs will end up playing the \"Cain\" role after all.. A few weeks ago, Dave listed all the wrestlers who have been arrested this year. Mushnick copied that list and said they had \"all been arrested on drug charges, mostly steroids.\" Dave says that's actually not true. Three of the names were arrested for non-drug issues, and of the others, 2 of the arrests were for marijuana. Only 2 people on the entire list were actually arrested for steroids. and talks about a wrestler named Vic Grimes who had a falls count anywhere match with someone named Erin O'Grady (later became Crash Holly). In the match, they wrestled out into the parking lot and at one point, O'Grady got in his car and was going at least 30MPH, if not faster, and drove towards Grimes and opened the car door and hit him with the door as he drove past. Dave says Grimes was uninjured but he worries what happens when other wrestlers inevitably try the same stunt or worse. is now working as a news anchor for WBZ in Boston.. Dave (with a hint of disgust) says WWC never went out of business and Brody's killer, Jose Gonzalez (Invader #1) was not only brought back to the company but has been pushed as the #2 babyface ever since.. They announced IWA was joining the NWA and brought out Dennis Coraluzzo as the head of the NWA, who cut a heel promo. The NWA is basically just a name at this point, so it means pretty much nothing. Ricky Steamboat is reportedly being brought in to work as a special referee at the next IWA show., with literal busloads of fans who traveled from out of state being turned away at the door. The night before, they also packed a show in Queens and had to turn people away at the door. The show was highlighted by Rick Rude turning heel to join Shane Douglas' Triple Threat stable, followed by Taz choking out Jerry Lawler. The Gangstas also won the tag titles from the Dudleys. At the show in Queens, Paul Heyman got on the mic and cut a big \"Fuck WWF\" type of speech. So that relationship is apparently going well. where a wrestler (El Puerto Ricano) apparently didn't sell long enough for Kronus's finisher. So after the match, Perry Saturn hit Ricano with an incredibly brutal shot with his crutch, which Ricano also apparently didn't sell enough for Saturn's liking. Backstage, Saturn confronted him and shoved him, but Ricano simply apologized and the situation was diffused. Speaking of Saturn, he's actually already off crutches (except on TV) and is walking with a knee brace. He's way ahead of schedule on his knee rehab and ECW thinks he may be ready to return by November.. ECW was strongly considering bringing in Dan Severn but Heyman feels that if they're going to bring in Severn, he wants to do a long build-up for it and have a Severn vs. Taz match on PPV and didn't want to waste Severn as a surprise 6-man tag match partner. They also considered making a deal with WCW in exchange for a settlement on the Raven deal but that fell through.? WWF claims Heyman gave them the tape and permission to use it, but Heyman flat out denies it and said you can tell by the low quality that it's a VHS dub and not a copy of the master footage that he would have given them if that was the case. Joey Styles is still said to be considering suing WWF for using the video (he's interviewing Austin in it) without his permission., but an anonymous source sent the college a video of the Mass Transit incident and the college pulled out of the deal. It's believed the source was a local promoter who didn't want ECW running a show in \"his\" territory. ECW denies it and says that the NKU location was considered but was never the official plan and that ECW themselves chose to move it to Florida. It's in ECW's best interest to at least pretend it was their decision because if they start having trouble booking buildings or start getting banned from cities, it makes them look like UFC, which has had so many problems booking locations. The \"Extreme\" name was a great marketing idea when Heyman came up with it, but now lots of media outlets and athletic commissions have lumped ECW in with the now-defunct Extreme Fighting promotion, which is a big red flag for the company in trying to book buildings or get TV and PPV deals. And of course, the Mass Transit tape is a potential time bomb that's always hanging over ECW's head and they were unhappy that this story got into the Observer (so they'll probably love this) because Request TV is still paranoid about bad publicity. ECW wants to sweep the Mass Transit tape under the rug and forget it ever happened, but there's always the concern that some major media outlet will pick up the story and air the footage and then it's game over. Speaking of, Eric Kulas (Mass Transit) still hasn't filed a lawsuit against ECW. Meanwhile, ECW has been trying to get medical reports from Kulas's family in order to find out the actual injuries but they haven't heard anything back.. They're already spending a lot of money to fly him in from California each week and Heyman wants him to be at the show early to work out in the ring, but Spicolli hasn't been doing it. He also threw a fit about doing a job to Tom Prichard last week and Heyman is pretty irritated at him overall. due to their album The Great Milenko. They appeared on Howard Stern's show this week and spent a lot of time talking about how they were big fans of ECW and that their favorite wrestler was Rob Van Dam. ICP said they'd be at the show in Queens the next night and they put over the show so big that Paul Heyman was crediting ICP for helping to draw such a big crowd that night., with the plan to do a Nitro taping from Yankee Stadium (didn't happen). (Hogan had a few movies come out in 97/98 but it looks like The Ultimate Weapon is the only one that was filmed in Montreal so probably that one.) to allow Hulk Hogan and Dennis Rodman to use \"Voodoo Child\" as their ring music for the next 12 months.. The Hart Foundation were huge babyfaces, while Shawn Michaels got booed like you wouldn't believe. Shawn did a back flip off the ropes to show his knee is just fine and then gave the NWO/Kliq hand signal at the camera. During his promo, he seemed out of it and his voice was gone and was slurring his words (yeah, Shawn was basically drugged out of his mind on TV every week at this point and it's super obvious). Also, the crowd chanted \"faggot!\" at him.: The Patriot came out with the American flag and was booed out of the building. Shawn was made the special referee for the Undertaker/Bret Hart match at Summerslam which led to Bret and Vince McMahon getting into a fight at ringside. And the show ran 10 minutes longer than normal, with USA Network running a crawl on the bottom of the screen saying La Femme Nikita would start in 10 minutes. (And thus, the traditional 8-10 minute overrun on Raw was born. Also, we're in that early-Attitude era of Raw where literally every episode seems to have some historic moment looking back on it).. Sid thought he was having a heart attack but he refused to go to the hospital and instead went back to his hotel. Sid has lost a lot of weight because his back injury has prevented him from working out, plus he's had the flu lately. that would keep him out for at least 6 months, but he's opted against the surgery and is planning to rehab it as best he can and return in September. (that would be the One Night Only PPV and ends up being one of the most egregious examples of just how much of a prick Shawn Michaels was in 1997. But we'll get there.) where guys ask Simmons to kick them in the kidneys so they can put on 30 pounds of muscle like Ahmed Johnson did after his kidney injury. is for him to debut in September or October.",

      "text": "I don't think I'll live past my mid twenties I honestly have no clue why I'm doing this. It partially makes me really uncomfortable, but who knows, maybe you guys can help.Ever since freshman year of high school, I've struggled with depression and anxiety. I don't remember much of anything in general before then, but I do distinctly remember feeling out of place–you know, like the extra friend, the weird girl, etc. I've actually gotten somewhat better about my friendships and not feeling that way, but that's because throughout high school I was in a peer counseling program which did help me, and I also started therapy.But now I'm 19, in my second year commuting to a university I fucking despise, and I've realized that I never really stopped thinking about suicide, at least every so often since maybe junior year of high school? At this point, it's been crossing my mind every few days. And I feel so fucking worthless, because I had this counselor and this therapist and these friends and family putting in effort to help me feel better and it didn't fucking work.I am planning on transferring colleges, and while I do think on a level that will make me feel better (and also give me a chance to get out of my childhood home, and challenge me more academically), these feelings always come back. This particular bout was inspired because I had a fight with my mom about my spending habits. I'm a really bad compulsive shopper/spender, and on some level I want to take steps to stop it, but I kind of don't know how and also really what's the point I don't particularly plan on sticking around that long. I know it's connected to this, because i shop so much because i feel very empty and ugly and worthless, and i kinda tried to explain that to my mom but it felt like it went over her head? Like she thought i was making excuses. I get why she was mad at me, but it's annoying. Everytime I say I want to figure out what's wrong with me—because there is something wrong. I'm not expressing self loathing, I shouldn't be fucking feeling this way–she never fucking listens and tells me not to \"Put myself in a box\". I almost feel like telling her to stop going to AA meetings, because she's putting herself in a box, but that'd be a dick thing to say Anyway, I just feel very empty and hollow. Although I do think my friends like me, I don't think they care about me the way I do them, and if they do, I also feel as though I'm a burden. I don't really have any long term goals–I just want to get into the college I plan on transferring to and finish my book. That's the only reason I may end up sticking around, honestly-if i'm dead, no one will finish my book. But when I think of the future, and also very often the present, I think of suicide in terms of something I'm just going to do, if that makes sense? Like, I feel like i'm bound to go through with it at some point.I mean, I don't cut myself anymore but I really fucking want to (another thing, a while back I promised a friend I wouldn't but i did after i promised him (another thing my mom unintentionally threw in my face), further validating the fact i'm garbage), and i've picked up smoking again. Of course, there's also my spending habits as another destructive coping mechanism. I guess i think if i get that dress from urban outfitters, i'll magically be pretty and won't want to kill myself, despite the fact that never fucking happens.Sometimes when I feel this way, I listen to The Cure. Usually Pornography or Disintegration. It makes me feel better-you know, like there's someone else out there who felt as shitty as I do and sometimes, it makes me feel like i might be okay.But then the thoughts come back, and part of me wonders if ending it would make it stop. Sorry that I cursed so much.",

She’s posting pictures of her body on tumblr and is getting into this whole “daddy” bdsm kink. It makes me feel so sick and pathetic to know that she left me for this life style.

I trusted her throughout the relationship until towards the end when I began to feel unloved and noticed she was changing. That’s when I became insecure and paranoid. She would always snoop through my stuff, accuse me of things, and controlled me, but the second I begin to assume somethings wrong, I’m the one over reacting and am called emotionally abusive. She wouldn’t let me communicate, so I didn’t know what to do. All I had left to do was worry. I wanted to trust her again but the lack of communication made it so hard.I feel so fucked over and empty and pathetic. If someone that was with me for 5 years would leave me like that, then who would ever want to be with me. I’ve worked on myself since the break up, and have received tons of compliments, but I still feel empty and not good enough. I made my ex so happy and gave her everything and took her everywhere, and it wasn’t enough. Everyone tells me she was the abusive one, but I don’t know what to believe honestly. My head feels so fucked I just want her out of my head I got so damn attached and she just threw it all away so easily.",

I see it as a very high-risk situation as they are directly posting on Facebook that they want someone to help them die, in the process of selling and giving away lots of possessions, and have survived a previous attempt (I'm not certain, but I think they used pills).They have been unable to keep work due to health issues that cause absences. They post about their depression and suicidal thoughts on Facebook almost constantly which is how I know of the previous attempt. The common themes are chronic pain ruining quality of life, financial distress, and feelings of betrayal and negative treatment from people thought to be close friends or loved ones.The financial issues cause a lot of unstable living situations and fear of being forced into homelessness. They recently posted about being kicked out by their significant other and while a few people offered to take them in (even with the 3 or 4 dogs they have) I haven't seen a response that they are open to the assistance (not to say this isn't happening in private).There are people offering emotional support, but there are also a lot of people being very casual about it despite so many direct statements about wanting to die for months; pretty much just taking the stuff and watching it happen. I have no idea if anything is in my power to help, but I don't want to just stand by and watch it happen.I'm aware of resources like crisis lines and programs that offer free or cost-reduced counseling, but they have stated being completely closed off to the idea of help. \"Those motherfuckers make it way worse,\" they said about suicide hotlines, and \"Realize no one can help me and I'm just telling people not to complain.\"It seems hopeless to me.

I'm 16 years old and have been heavily depressed/suicidal for a good 4 years now. I struggle immensely with aspergers and social anxiety and that has hindered me severely with trying to \"fit in\" or \"be normal\". I was in a lot of discontent with my life but I managed, believing that i could just soldier on and almost suck it up in a sense; however when I finished high school I had a lot of time to think and reflect, and to be quite honest with you it has really accentuated how utterly dull and mundane everything around me has become - food doesn't taste as great, music doesn't sound as great, nothing feels like its good anymore. I debated very heavily to end my life but in all honesty, I really don't want to fucking die. When it chooses to, life can be such a wonderful place filled with joy and beauty and substance, but that euphoria has become very short and very far apart. I recently started higher education to try and maybe get some purpose in my life or try and distract myself from the sadness/suicidal thoughts by being a more academic person, but that in term made it a lot worse because it again acted as a catalyst that reminded me at how awkward i really am. I feel really dumb because I can't really concentrate much in lessons and therefore I miss out on a lot of learning. I feel really anxious because I always feel like people are looking at me and judging me and every time i walk past someone laughing i instantly assume it's about me. I feel overwhelmed because everything caught up with me very quickly and i feel like my sadness is starting to eat away at any chance of getting better. I tried professional help but it didn't work and it made me feel worse about myself because i felt like a big burden to my family.I really have no fucking idea what to do /sw/, I really want to live and be content with everything but the sheer idea of things being the way they are makes me so very depressed that it's starting to affect my physical health too; my hair is falling in clumps, my skin looks like utter shit, i'm steadily gaining weight, my self esteem is dropping to basically nothing, i always feel tired and unmotivated.I'm just so sick of it all. If you read this far then thank you, and I hope you have/had a wonderful day.",

I could go home, but that was a few miles uphill, and I didn't really feel interested in going home. I kind of just wanted to keep walking forever and ever...disappearing came to mind. So did suicide, which is not an unfamiliar topic to pass by me....then someone leaving the place from where I'd walked early pulled over and offered me a ride, then insisted when they noticed that I looked distressed. I'm home safe now. I'm just freaked out that all that happened so quickly and without barely any premeditation.",

I now hate society and everyone around me to the point where I just can't take it anymore, those that care about me I just end up treating like shit and making myself feel even worse. For example, I started talking to this girl and today it ended after just only 20 days of us being friends, because my selfish cunted self couldn't handle her having a boyfriend. She was the first girl I had an actual conversation with for 3+ years, and if it took that long for me to find her, then I have no hope for the future, especially if I treat her and everyone else like shit. All I want is to have her back for someone to talk to, but I've royally fucked it and her boyfriend probably hates me too. My job is shit and I have no direction in life, did a course at college that I didn't want to do, but did anyways because I was scared of being on my own. I just sit here day after day, just contemplating ending it all. The only reason I haven't yet is because I don't want to put my family through such shit times, though I know it's going to happen soon.

He is ending it.

I went through most of secondary school with depression because various amounts of different people bullied me. Once I finished school at 16 I thought it would get better but when a new door opens in my life I feel like copious amounts of shit comes with it. I'd always had a reason to be depressed or to cut myself, up until a year ago. Last summer was hard for me. 2016 was a shit year for me, the best part of the year was when I went to a music festival. I'd taken a fair amount of drugs at this festival and once I got home to my family, the comedown was intense and made living at home real shit for a week, after that week it didn't get better. The festival blues are a real thing, mixed in with a comedown and already underlying depression was not a nice combo. My relationship with my parents deteriorated a lot and I was on the brink of becoming homeless. I moved out of my parents house as it was become homeless or eventually commit suicide. I moved in with some friends and had such an incredible couple of months. Things went south with a housemate and there was a lot of tension and a lot of arguments. We had some other peeps move in and everything's great, I've never actually been in such a good home situation in my adult life before. I don't feel particularly depressed, sure a bit down but nothing to what I've experienced previously. I hate this world, I hate our species and I hate our existence. This whole world is driven by money and your life is gonna be fucking terrible without it. I'm done with working a shit job for bog standard money and getting shit on left, right and centre by bosses. I want my life to amount to something and I know it never will. I can't even find a man that's attracted to me and wants to be with me. I'm finding it harder and harder everyday to come up with a reason to carry on my life. I don't want to upset my family. The thought of that breaks my heart but I'm physically and mentally tired of trying to fight the same battle after 11 years. My family don't deserve the death of their daughter and my friends don't deserve a death if a friend. I can't carry on this way. I'm sorry that this is long. I can't tell anyone this.",

For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a incredibly abusive and toxic personality disorder. My Father allowed this for years, until she attempted suicide underneath my bed on one Thanksgiving and was removed from my home.Following this I grew up with maids and nannys because my father was often at work. One of them was abusive towards me for serval years but never left marks on my body. My father never believed me. So when CPS came over (as they did multiple times) nothing was ever done.I was sent to a boarding school for two years when I was a teenager by my ex stepmother. Whom my father married after knowing her for a week on eharmony. Really fucked up place. One of the staff members that managed me actually gave birth to a child under her dorm room deck and left it there to die (Google: Jesscia Bradford, JYA), no one noticed until it started it stink.As an adult. It look me awhile to get used to being a person again if that makes sense. I took some LSD, went to some amazing music festivals. I stopped drawing as often and became an aerialist, it was extremely cathartic. Doing it professionally across the country helped me see and experience a lot.Starting last year I cried about it a bit, then got over myself and became a stripper. Gigs alone were good money but weren't enough to keep me moving forward in life while in a stable place. Also my father had quit working at that point because of his depression, my family was living off of food donations at home. I knew I needed to do something for my future that was fast money. The job itself can be pretty depressing (sometimes hilarious), but overall excellent money. I worked hard for a year. I bought a car, payed off all previous medical debts, furnished my apartment..Things were finally starting to look up for me. I was finally starting to get stable and then start saving to go back to college. Then I found out my family had lost health coverage because my father quit paying the bill six months ago, I was once again swamped with medical debts that were not my fault (also may I add I found this out after I had loaned him money for his car payments that month, he knew what my job was) this time.I injured myself while training last month. I have no health insurance to get treatment, I cannot walk around to go make money to afford the treatment or get another job. I have 1000$ saved and that will only get me an MRI. My county indigent will not take me. I make too much per month. I cannot find a sliding scale clinic in my county who does orthopedics.I am 24 years old now. I have tried, and fucking tried my best. I think I'm ready to go. I just got my DL two years ago, I have nine credit hours in college, and my father spent my inheritance. I'm tired of men touching me who don't give a fuck about me. I'm tried of feeling alone with no one to turn to for help. I'm sick of feeling trapped. If I have to live in a country where people are so selfish for resources that we don't even have tax paid universities and tax paid doctors... I don't think I want to exist in it anymore. If letting twenty different men a night suck my tits is the fastest and most efficent way to pay for these things, rather than being stuck in debt for years with no place to live in the meantime... It's the kind of tired that sleep won't fix.",

      "text": "Sounds weird but im a bit new to this So to start i just want to say that when i was a kid reading was used as a punishment for me so as i grew up i never really read at all. I know its depressing. I started reading comics and recently i started going to bookstores to find full books. Today i picked up some books at Barnes and noble earlier but i couldn't really stay to read them and i didn't have time at home today. What i did read of them though i loved but i notice that when im home i don't care to read but i think that's because of my general environment. When i was at the store i really wanted to sit and read as much as i could so i guess my question is if its alright if i walk in with the books that i got at the store tomorrow or just some time in general and sit there and read them. So i would be walking in with my own books to read them at the book store even though i got them there. Also is there any books you guys would suggest? I really like informative books about psychology and philosophy but at the same time a good story that has a good amount of depth to it would be fantastic. Im open to any suggestions.Edit: Thank you for the feedback on this. Ill definitely be going to a coffee shop or the library tomorrow. I don't know why but that didn't really cross my mind so im thankful for the info.",

Goodwill has dried up though and I think this is the closest I’ve ever been to actually being done with everything.I feel like suicide isn’t an option, though, because of the chaos it throws everybody else into. It feels like such a selfish cop-out, but that fact is literally the only thing keeping me from doing it.For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a cycle where I enter a new phase of my life, be optimistic for the first couple of years, fall into a pattern of apathy about where I’m at, get into awful depressive slump, bide time until next opportunity comes up.This is the end of the cycle though. I’m locked in to my situation for the next few years, with no foreseeable end coming up. I started this phase off fairly horribly, and I can feel the end of the runway here getting closer and closer. Lately I have been able to suppress those thoughts for the most part but everything seems to be creeping up on me. I have always held fairly firmly to the idea that suicide was not an option simply because whatever problems it ends for me, it creates tenfold for everybody else around me, but I can feel my brain getting really close to that line.How does everybody else deal with getting close to that edge? Is there some way you hit the reset button on everything? I’ve never felt able to lean on friends or family about any of this because the response is always puzzled and/or shocked and it always makes me regret having ever opened up about it. I consider myself a pretty analytical person and right now I feel like the only path forward is doing things as I’ve always done, but the problem is inching ever closer to that state of mind where I feel like it’s time to just get it over with.",

      "text": "Can You Guys Please Tell Me Why Is It You Feel Like Dying Is The Only Solution I know this might seem like a very unpersonal question, but I am really interested in knowing the events that have led and why do other people feel like they can't just go through the next day. I am not suicidal right now, but I often find myself thinking that I should have taken more pills or should have let the blood go and cut longer. But if anyone's interested please share. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FOLLOWING LONG ASS TEXT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, JUST WRITE DOWN YOUR STORY. Anyways, here's me:I am 16, male. Well if you really wanna start from the beginning, I was sexually abused from 2006 (the year my parents got divorced) to early 2010 and just when I started to understand what was going on, my grandma died so I couldn't really tell my mom because grief hit her really hard. During this time I changed schools because I had no friends and kids were really mean (I used to play Barbies with my cousin) and I started classes at this new school. As a 10 year old I loved Child's Play, Fright Night, Dracula and Van Helsing a lot so I sometimes played like I was a vampire at school, and so rumors started going around that I was satanic and that I drank blood from used tampons and band aids. Then in 2012 (I was 11) I was raped again by another man and I didn't tell anyone because I feared they'd call me a faggot again (sorry if it sounds homophobic, but thats how it happend). I started screaming at night, taking long ass showers and fantasizing about death. I started cutting my stomach. It got better for a while, I had friends, I was getting along with my family but then on February 2013 in a class trip (on Galapagos islands for two weeks) my ex classmates were staying at our same hotel. They told everyone about me as a kid and as you might expect no one talked to me for the rest of the trip. My friends kinda felt ashamed of being around me and when we got back home bullying started with jokes about my past, my weight, and a video I uploaded on Youtube about me and the \"Pear Phones\". I hid my rape story for people not to call me a fag again but they did anyways so I tried to kill myself for the first time using growth syrup. Lots of it. I just got diarreha so no biggy. After that it actually started going well. I actually was popular for a while and then my friends started making me aside and as a 14 year old the movie Thirteen kinda triggered me and I started cutting again (really superficial). Then on September 2015 my voice started to change, and I freaked out and I took the dumbest decision of my life. I decided to fake it so the change of my voice wouldn't be felt. Two weeks into class and I wanted to go back to my regular voice, but surprise surprise, my real voice was actually a lot deeper than the one I was using. So long story short I continued faking it until July 2017. On 2016 my fake voice was starting to break every five seconds and I was speaking lower and lower, so naturally people started noticing. Every oral presentation every reading out loud in class, people laughed at me. On summer vacations I told myself I had to stop faking my voice because it would fuck up everything, but as I faked it with my family I kinda found it imposible to stop. So I continued and the first week of class September 2016 we did a lot of reading as a class and that exact week I was kinda sick, so it sounded horrible. The following months the bullying was really intense. Everytime my name was mentioned or I opened my mouth people would laugh scream at me names, say that I was throat fucked up a hammer, etc. I was scared of hanging out with my friends because if I did, they would mention my voice immediately. So I was alone for a long time, but I still had hope. New Year's Eve I was walking with my pug (my literal shoulder to cry on) and asking if I would make it through this year. I was going to therapy since November because the school told my mom I was seen \"alone and sad\". I just needed a friend. I really needed one, so I thought that if I acted cool with this guy and didn't tell him the shit I did I would have one friend. Bad call. Then my mom told me we were moving to Chile on March (it was Feb 08 I think the day she told me) and I fell into a deep deep depression. I cried a lot because I didn't wanna leave my family and I still hoped I could make it work with my friends. Then my birthday came and it started going well, and me and an old friend (who kinda teased me a lot and didnt really like me but felt bad for me anyways) invited about 22 people to eat on the Friday of my birthday week. Three people showed up and they all went to hang out without me after so then I realised I had no actual friends anymore. On March 2nd one of my best \"friends\" turned 16 and I checked his page and I just checked mine again (my bd is on Feb 19) and felt really bad with myself and I just took every pills I found at home (about 16) and I took them, hoping it would kill me. It didn't. Then my mom and I settled that she'd go by herself to Chile on March 20th and I'd join her when I finished this year. So she left and I went to live with my dad and grandparents who started saying that they knew I was faking my voice and I had to speak like a man, which made me feel shitty. I also stopped going to therapy because it was to far away from my grandparents house. I started cutting again (very superficially) but I had my dog to keep me sane and unrequited love to keep me looking foward. My dog started walking a little bit weird but I thought it was just from playing with my grandparents dog and then on a Saturday his legs were not working. I rushed him to the vet thinking it was a broken leg and the doctor said he had multiple tumors on his back and coxis. I was still optimistic even though everyone said the treatment would be too expensive and hurt ful for him. I stayed from 10 PM to 3 AM cleaning his legs and body from his shit and pee and trying to make him walk. On Sunday we had agreed to discuss what we were going to do with him, so we got there on Sunday (me and my older brother) morning. They put him to sleep. I couldn't take it. My pride was just too damn big that I couldn't let my brother or the doctors see me cry so I kissed my pug the hardest I had ever kissed anyone and I left him there just when they started injecting him. I hated myself so much for leaving him alone when he needed me the most. He was there everytime I was bullied so hard at school that I didn't want to wake up the next day, and he only needed me for a few minutes and I couldn't even give him that. I sneaked in home, I got the 30 Buprex 400mg pills I bought and I started writting a note, I stopped however when I heard my dad and brother shouting if they had seen me anywhere. And I knew how shitty they'd feel if I did it so I didn't do it.The bullying started to become unberable. I however understood that the people were not the ones to blame. If every single classmate, every teacher, every store clerk, every old lady, every old friend, if everyone joked/talked/laughed over my voice it wasn't their fault but mine. So everytime it happend I would go home look at myself in the mirror and cry. I had everything planned out to kill myself. The notes. The pictures. Videos of myself telling my family that I loved them and that they should not blame themselves at all. It was June so the presure of finals and going to a new country and starting a new life really scared me. I was really scared that I would fuck it up again. The last day of school the counselor told everyone I was moving to Chile and they were all surprisingly upset. We had known each other since we were kids so I guess I could see why. Two days before my departure my whole family hired this party bus to say say goodbye. It was really loud so I couldn't speak at all. I came home and I was feeling really angry and sad at myself for not enjoying the farewell gift they hsd given me. That night I decided to try to kill myself slitting my wrists. I bought this brand new razors (I had been cutting almost daily and really deep for a while by then with this old blade) and I pressed as hard as usual, this razor was really sharp however and I bled a lot. I decided to make the bleeding stop pressing it with toilet paper. The next day my ex friend (who didnt really like me but pittied me and helped me plan my birthday) had been my best friend for about 4 years in a row and he threw me a farewell party. Out of the like 60 guests only 30 showed up, but I had a great time (because weed and alcohol baby). My cut of the night before got accidentaly open again and I started bleeding like crazy. My whole sleeve was black from the blood and there was blood everywhere on the ground. So I spend pretty much my whole party on the bathroom. The next day (the day before my departure I had to make my bags, and I was couldn't stop crying. It was about 10 PM and my bag wasn't done. My mom who came back from Chile started screaming at me. I just decided to say fuck it. I followed my mom into the living room. I said goodbye to my brother to my mom (and hugged her) and told them I loved them. I went into my room. Locked the door. Put all my stuff in a corner. Left the note in the bed. Opened the shower, ripped my crost and slit my other wrist. It was 11 PM I think and I woke up around 2:13 AM surrounded by blood with my neck and head hurting, feeling kinda sick and with my arms hurting. I don't know if it was that I wasnt thinking straight but I cleaned up the blood and made my bags.",

My girlfriend and I have been getting more and more hostile (verbally, not physical) We argue just about everyday and it just makes me not want to do anything anymore.Just today, we were driving to get lunch and we sparked an argument and I told her to just take me home because I didn't feel like being in public. Without going into extreme details, we were both at fault but won't admit it.I'm not solely feeling depressed just because of my girlfriend and I are arguing, it's just part of it. I usually wake up and just want to sleep all day. I feel useless and mopey throughout the day. I'm also extremely angry most of the time and don't know why. I'm scared and really don't know what to do.",

She'd been struggling with PTSD since she was raped a year or two ago, and the court hearing last weekend didn't go well. A mutual friend and I planned to visit her this weekend. She told our friend that she was on a plane, going cross country, on credit. Admittedly suicidal. \"Sorry for being a wretched friend\".She told me a few times never to stop reaching out, but she may be extremely distrustful of men right now. Our sole mutual friend is in a dark place, herself, and can't safely talk to her.I'm coping with the possibilities as calmly as I can - not my first rodeo - but I don't know what else to do other than text a few kind words every one or two days. She replied with a single heart last Tuesday, otherwise a lack of feedback, justified distrust (in men), and her chronic guilt of being a \"bad friend\" is making it difficult to choose the right words.I'll be calling a suicide hotline tonight for advice. Anything else in the meantime?Edit: I just clued in that the trip might be a lie and she could be gone. Will continue as if it's true.",

      "text": "My whole family is dead, I have no friends, I feel trapped in memories and I'm hallucinating. I'm 29 and my life was very normal growing up. Was valedictorian in college, had two seemingly loving parents and a fiancee I'd been dating since I was 18. About six years ago I discovered that my fiancee was cheating on me and I was devastated. She quickly married this guy after six years of dating me. I moved back in with my parents and things were ok for a while. I had a good job but I was having a lot of problems getting back on my feet emotionally. Then it turned out that my mom was cheating on my dad and he confronted her about it. That week they both died in a car accident, with the suspicion that my mom (the driver) did it on purpose as a murder-suicide kind of thing related to the affair. I am living in their house, my childhood home, and am starting to have a hard time paying the rent. I've been able to keep it up for now because the bank is letting me keep paying it as the executor of their estate but I don't even know if I'll be able to refinance and it's cheaper than paying rent anywhere. I might end up homeless if it doesn't work out.I am in therapy and it does not seem to help. I don't get social media and don't even have a phone. The one friend I did have killed himself a few years ago, before all this happened.I have this feeling that my life is not real and that everything from this point on is just meaningless. Whatever happens I feel like I'm controlling a body that is not my own, and I have these thoughts that all \"I\" am is just a series of electrical impulses going through meat. When I die I'll forget I ever existed, forget the concept of existence in the first place because there will be no conceptual realization of consciousness whatsoever. The universe will cease to exist and will be like it never existed, just like it must be for my parents now. All those experiences and things I've made, all the people I've ever met and loved, will be unmade in an instant.During my daily routine of going to my office and then home, I am starting to see things. I am seeing the lights turn out when they are actually on. I am seeing faces peering at me from doors left cracked. I see my parents and even my old girlfriend in my dreams every night and wake to a reality that is not my own. I can barely plod through work and my days seem to happen without me having any knowledge about them. I sit at my desk and am vividly trapped in endless loops of memories - songs, experiences, movies, smells that defined my life throughout high school and college, the things that seem so desperately to be \"me\" even though the world goes on without me. Since the day I graduated I feel like I have been in stasis, watching the world around me change and evolve while I slowly degrade due to incompatibility. The loss of my fiancee was a big blow, and the death of my parents is a far greater shock that I cannot even describe. They were really my only friends, and now I am caught in an endless cacophany of betrayal and bottomless sadness.I just heard a baby cry in my office and there is nobody else here. I have about ten or so moments like this during the day.Sometimes I dream that I will hang myself by the neck over a small bridge near my house. It's never a rope but always a heavy metal chain. Sometimes I can feel a loose link cutting into my neck as I take the plunge over the side. It's endless - either the hanging or my lost loved ones, or both. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, or even more importantly WHY I should keep it up. I feel like my entire existence is a mistake and that I will always be spending my life pining for a time long gone, listening for voices long dead.I don't know what I'm doing here but I had to type this out and I don't know if it made things better, but I typed it out nonetheless. Thank you for listening.",

They were so healthy and bouncy.As a child I grew up in a predominantly Caucasian town. There was one Afro-Centric boy at my elementary school, and one other mixed girl. Her mix however is Japanese and British. My mix is Irish, and Bajan. My mother never really knew how to take care of my hair. As I grew older my grandmother told me to cut my hair. That's not true though. It was my father who told me to cut my hair. I don't know why I stuck to that story for so long.I was often bullied for my skin colour, my hair... I couldn't understand it. I didn't get the joke, or that I was the joke. My mother is a blonde with green eyes. I myself have green eyes and brown hair. My skin is not very dark. Yet I was always compared to shit.I remember a girl hit me and pulled my finger back as I rose my hand to answer a question. I cried of course, and when the teacher asked her \"Why?\" Her response was as simple as \"She's different than \" When I tried to point out the prejudice in her statement I was scolded and sent back to the classroom.Anyways, I later permed my hair, straightened it and it was destroyed. Short, dry hair. Finally into my adult life (about 20 years of age) I decided to grow it. It took a long while for it to repair itself.I wore my hair down at work today. Threw together the shaggiest outfit In existence, paired it with some two dollar flip flops and headed out.My day was the same. Nothing eventful or new. One co-worker even said to me \"You look like you got smashed last night.\" However towards the end of the day many of the girls were complimenting my hair, saying how healthy it looked. I became really self conscious after that.I hate standing out. I fidgeted with my hair all the way home. I thought my hair looked ugly that day, but they kept saying how pretty it was.It adds to me feeling like everything is fake, or my perception is incredibly flawed. It was comparable to when you see a very fat person, and tell them they are fit. . .Like it's a lie.Anyways. Acceptance from my peers or compliments doesn't change anything. I still feel so blurry.On the upside, I finally have beautiful curly hair.6 days and counting.",

People say that the abused go on to abuse I think I'm turning into a monster and I can't stop it. The more I fight the thoughts the stronger they come the more elaborate they become but if I don't fight them I feel dirt and horrible. I feel like a monster and I want to kill myself for it. I get nightmares that he comes back and abused all my friends and he forces me into a monster who has to do whatever he wants. I don't want to hurt anyone and I never have. But these thoughts. They will not stop . I always worry that i'm turning into a pedo I'm always scared. I'm always scared that maybe I hurt my brother or someone in the past but don't remember. I've been to the GP 4 times with no help nothing. I told my Dad 3-4 times about the molestation when I was small only to have him ignore me and tell me to forget about it.I told my mum and she just gave me anointed oil and tells me to put it on my head. It's like this is a joke. It's not a joke at all. Why can nobody see that? This is terrifying and I don't know what to do. I've asked for help many times and I've always been ignored. Maybe it's because I'm a girl if a male came with these thoughts they would put him in a mental hospital asap. But because I'm a short innocent looking girl soft spoken I'm a joke. I have nowhere to turn. What should I do I really think killing myself is the best. I protect my brother from my thoughts and I stop suffering in this way. I've exhausted all other options. I've tried I really have but to no avail. This has made me loose my faith in god I prayed all the time but I saw myself slipping away whilst I felt like talking to a brick wall. What farther would let his child suffer like this after begging for help . All I do is cry and sleep. I can't concentrate I push my brother away because i'm so scared I can't even sit without worrying.",

      "text": "First off, I'd like to acknowledge that my problems are probably quite insignificant when compared to others that come to this board. I should be happy. I'm 18 (whole life ahead of me, right?), I come from a wealthy family, I got the chance to grow up abroad, I attend a fairly decent college in the US, I'm not disabled mentally or physically, I have a family that cares about me, I don't have an identity (sexual, gender, etc.) that might distance me from my peers, I'm not physically unattractive (or so I've been told, I dunno), but I think I'm done with life. Also, I'd like to apologize for the damn-near essay that follows. What else would you expect from a humanities major?I've felt this way for a long time, but I'll skip most of that time period and start in high school. Throughout the majority of high school, I never really had any friends, which is entirely my fault. Towards the end I made a couple of close-ish friends, but they're gone now. Plus, I think they were only there because they knew how unhappy I was. I think I only really made it to college alive because I was really fairly dependent on alcohol in the months leading up to me coming here. But now (in college, of all places), that crutch is gone. So far, I have absolutely no friends in college. I have absolutely no one I can talk to. Every time I've even slightly mentioned anything about my emotional state, people get scared and run off. I've been fairly reliant on my friends from high school to talk to, but I am almost certain that they've tired of me. Well, I'm absolutely sure one of them has, and she was the only one that really mattered to me. Now, I just lie to everyone and tell them that I'm ok. I'm not. I've tried to hang myself twice before, but both times I panicked right before I lost consciousness. I've overdosed on my meds (which I've stopped taking) three times. It was Zoloft, so I knew it wouldn't be fatal. I've got a noose hidden in my room. I've put it around my neck a couple times already and tested if the knot will hold. I just need one more thing to push me over the edge. I can't help but feel that the rest of my life has nothing in it really. I know that some of my thoughts (which, because of their complete lack of reason, I won't go into) are just the depression talking, but I know that I'm not going to be cut out for anything great. No girl will ever find me as a viable option romantically (have you ever had a girl give you the \"yeah...no thanks\" look?) so I know I'm going to end up alone, or in some passionless relationship in which my supposed partner will have decided to just settle for less. If you can't tell based on the lack of structure in this paragraph, I'm not even sure what point I'm trying to get at anymore. I just know I don't want to be here. I'm sorry to waste your time, if any of you bothered to read this far.",

Now I need a new muffler, and to pass an emission test, or I cannot legally drive to work when my knee gets better.I am grinding like a mad man, but shelling out for physio therapy to get my knee fixed is costing me a ton, but if I don't do it then I'll be laid up in bed for months and then I won't be able to work, and then I won't be able to pay rent.I have 46$ in my bank account that needs to last my the rest of the month.Life is just exhausting. I work as hard as I can. But I can never pull myself out of this pit.I'm not sad or anything, just hopeless. Not depressed, just stuck.There is no escape for me.",

      "text": "Do you think 'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro is a masterpiece? I just finished this book. I started it after I saw multiple people on a reddit thread calling it a masterpiece. I...am not sure how far that's true. Without doubt, Ishiguro is the master of subtext. There's beauty and magic in the way he conveys two distinct, often contradictory layers of information with the same words.Further, the way the book portrays the picture of a man who secretly wished to be so much more than a butler but had come to find a false satisfaction by teaching himself otherwise is brilliant. The story of this one insignificant man's personal conflict amidst the backdrop of far greater conflicts raging all about him is somehow both cozy and compelling.And the ending is absolutely incredible. It made me want to stay with the book, to not let it end, and that's definitely commendable.But despite all this, one great flaw consistently hampered my enjoyment of the book. The story is written in first person by a butler, as basically his memoir. But all the while I was reading, to me it was always Kazuo Ishiguro writing about a butler's life. I could notice the research and the effort, when I felt I never should have been able to.There was a lack of detail in general that would be present if an actual butler would narrate his life, a 'background buzz' in the narration that was absent. Further, the content that WAS there as a means to provide authenticity to the character's life as a butler was highlighted too much, as if the author was holding it up to me and saying 'look, this detail feels real and authentic, doesn't it?', a prime example being the whole silver polishing reference. Details like this are also repeated frequently enough to break immersion and exacerbate the issue.I feel that the job of a good writer of fiction is to appear to be simply the chronicler of a story, rather than its creator, and Ishiguro missed the mark here.I don't mean to say that he failed with the book. It's a damn fine story told well. Maybe he wasn't able to find enough research to bring the authenticity the book needed, and that's a shame, but the end result is that 'The Remains of the Day' remains firmly in the zone of 'a good book that could've been much better' for me.What are your thoughts?",

How could I have listened to this advice? Two of these \"undesirable\" trees were 50+ years old. Many were 15 - 30 years old. Now I find myself stuck in a toxic cycle of rumination, doubt, anxiety, and self critique. Some of the dead trees are in view of the neighbors, and I'm fearful that they know what I did.

She went to the hospital earlier this month for an attempt, but has told everyone she is doing much better. But I've talked to her when things are bad, and I'm very worried about this person. I have told her everything I know how, but nothing seems to get through. She has a counselor and a psychiatrist, but wants to stop seeing them. She is convinced that she will never feel better, so the only way out is suicide. She says she's just so sick of trying, and having nothing change. The only thing left I can think of is to call the cops on her when things get bad. The biggest issue with that, though, is that she has these mental problems because of an abusive family. When she attempted last time, the first thing her dad told her is that she is stupid and selfish, because the ambulance ride was expensive. She also said her stay in the hospital did not help her, she was just bored and miserable until she told them what they wanted to hear and they let her go. So even if I do get her admitted against her will, the odds are good that things will only get worse for her. And if I don't, I'm almost certain she will try again anyway. Nothing I say or do has been able to get through to her, because she just wants to die. She doesn't want help, she doesn't want to put the work into feeling better, she just wants to give up. And I have no idea how to handle that. I'm really scared. If anyone has advice, I could really use some. Thank you.",

Since I was pissed I deleted some of the files on the FTP but they changed the ip and restored everything. I realized I would have done much more destruction through the admin control panel via FTP but I didn't realize that until after. I got kicked out from other forums for not taking shit from the staff. For example in one of them, I created something and one of the staff decided to steal it and declare it as his own. That caused me to leak the source code for everyone to use and both me and the mod lost sales. I felt better that he couldn't monetize from that any longer. This led to me being blacklisted from every event the whole staff team would do, or actual staff applications. Another forum incident was, I was selling another one of my programs, of course no license since I'm lazy to add that in. This guy buys it, and shares the license with his friend. Once something went wrong with the program, he , his friend and about 30 more decided to mock me and bring my reputation down. Then he demanded I help him and his friends and I refused due to him breaking my purchase policies. The staff sided with this guy and got me banned for not refunding/fixing his program.For the friend part, I stopped coding and spent most of my time playing games with them ( 3-4 ). In short, I realized that only one really wanted me there and the other 3 preferred to play without me. I like being kind of a leader, saying what to do , what not to do and what I should do instead of them. Such as, let's drop there ( PUBG ) or let me be that character since you don't really know how to use it ( rainbow six siege ). All my online friends found other friends to talk to / play with/ code with. My best friend found a job and is working 8 hours a day and going everywhere without me with minimum contact with me. The only times he invites me out, I actually can't meet him due to me being with my girlfriend ( being the weekends. )Basicly now I have nowhere to go or anything to do rather than code. But what is the point of coding if I can't sell my creations anywhere in their specific famous forums. I go to gym every morning and sleep at 5 am. The only person who ignores my leadership characteristic is my girlfriend and she puts up with all my crap. She basicly is the only person that makes me feel happy and wanted.

I am so tired of just looking around and seeing flourishing lives that I try so hard to be apart of, but I'm just not the right person for people. Everyone always has someone so much better to go to. I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish I could just be normal like everyone and be happy again. I can't even remember the last time someone hugged me or told me to have a good day or whatever. I try so hard to be a good friend to everyone but they always leave me.And I constantly am not enough for my mom. I made A's and B's in high school but she wanted me to graduate with honors and ribbons. She wanted me on the dean's list in college like my dad was, and then I got into my freshman year of college and failed one class out of the three I could take, which completely fucked me over. Now I don't know how I'm gonna pay for college, and I can't imagine how fucking disappointed she is with me. I can't live with knowing that the only person who I love and want to make happy anymore thinks I'm a fucking failure of a child. I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to buy her a giant house and get her that convertible she's always wanted, but I'm never going to do that as long as I keep showing her that I'm probably her biggest regret.I just can't. It sounds really pathetic but I don't see my life getting any better. I've been feeling like this since I was 13 and as cheesy and pathetic as it sounds, it's only getting worse. And honestly, I feel like I'm just taking up space. My mom has three other kids who still have potential to make her smile. I've failed at that as well as just making friends. My only best friend told me to \"get over it\" when I talked about this emotional stuff (I wish I was joking about that, but I'm sadly not) and so I just keep it to myself now.I don't know what I keep doing wrong in every aspect of my life, but I'm quite tired of it. And I just don't wanna keep breathing for the sake of nothing. I'm just taking up space from other people. And I don't want to do this anymore. I clearly can't function correctly like everyone else. And I just don't wanna feel so alone anymore. So when the time comes this year, I'll probably just leave. I don't know how, but I will. And that'll be less pressure off of everyone's shoulders.

I don't want to be alive anymore, or rather, I simply wished I didn't exist. Just needed to get that out. To anyone that reads this, thank you.",

Realising that crushed me. Now I have the choice to either sit through this hell or finally end the pain I feel every day. I don't think anyone can understand what realising that I couldn't kill myself without hurting the people I love means, only someone suffering like me knows how much that hurts, it's worse that hitting rock bottom because at rock bottom you have only one way to go and that's up, what we feel is hitting rock bottom and to try to go up will tear your family apart.

      "text": "I wish I was dead, or never born. Since I can remember I have always known that I don't belong, one of the first things I can clearly remember was my fathers hate of me, his anger that I was even a being. His disgusted looks at me made him harm me and witness the evils of a mans capabilities.I am free of his gaze and feel nothing for him, yet since I was 3 I have made many attempts and one of the first thoughts of any given day is that 'why am I still alive', and one of the last thoughts of any given day is 'I hope I don't wake up'.People around me know of part of my struggles and how I feel, but they see me wanting to commit suicide as a selfish act, like most people do, but to me what's selfish is wanting someone around, who is suffering and see no end to that suffering. I understand why people commit suicide and I don't think they are selfish, we all just want the pain to go away and for some the only way to do so is to commit suicide, what's selfish about that?I believe that I am here to suffer and endure. I am a witness to humanity and I've seen every facet of the evil in a person. Very rarely I see goodness and kindness, and even then I question if it's for selfish reasons.We are all selfish beings who want what we want, I hate that aspect of myself.My first attempt was at aged 3 (yes 3 you read correctly) I set alight my bed as I knew fire purged wrong's from the world. As the fire licked at my skin it did not burn, and simply was extinguished.Another attempt was around 12 when knowing how to tie knots and the tensile strength of the rope I used, I could achieve the goal of ending my suffering. A proper tight noose was tied and as I kicked the chair over the beam supporting my weight, the rope snapped as though someone swung a sword. the strands of rope were cleanly cut, yet what I witnessed was an impossibility just as I saw 9 years previous.A year or so later at aged 14 I was walking back from school, and there was a high walking bridge that went across a dual-carriageway, I stopped and knew it was time for me to try once more and so I stood over the railings and let go. The reason I am able to write about this today is because my foot was caught in the railing, leaving me hanging upside down like in the cartoons when a character is trapped by another. Managing to get myself up with the aid of another I simply limped home with a somewhat twisted ankle. I told the person that a bully had tried to throw me over.Other attempts have included poison's, stepping out in front of vehicles (yes this is a bad one but when your in that mindset you don't care) I have and never would attempt to jump in front of a train (that's just not right, having someone clean miles long tracks).It would appear that I am here for something, as every attempt I make is circumvented somehow.There is a lot I could write or say to my story but I guess I am still searching for a cure to my suffering and pain. I am in receipt of medical help and support though I feel that currently there is no new information that I don't already know, or could find for myself. A long and slow process I am sure. At 25 I feel as I always have; empty, alone and in pain.",

      "text": "So most people have something they strive to fullfil in life. Some of us want to become doctors, some writers, some parents. And those around them want to see them succeed and support them with whatever they can do.I share some of those wishes too. But the one thing that I really want to happen above all else will never be supported by those around me. I want to die; I've wanted to die for more than half my life.Life is full of beautiful things and the world is incredibly beautiful. When you are moved by an emotional movie, when you help a friend surpass a long-term challenge, when you ace your courses after a semester of hard work. These things make you feel like the world is right.But then there's the other side of the coin: the things that make you not content with what the world is. When somebody you admired dies. When your lover breaks up with you. When, after much hard work and devotion, you are still unable to pass half your credits, and drop out of school.All of these are terrible events... But, in a way, they are beneficial to you. Much like how getting together with that special person gave you so much pleasure, breaking up with them fills you with sadness. It reminds you that you're living. It's what allows that pleasure to exist in the first place.No, the really crippling side of life is not those rare but catastrophic events.It's your everyday.When you wake up, and your only notifications are about how you've neglected to submit your financial aid documents for the third day in a row.When you send a friend a text, and they don't answer.When you hear that people are secretly talking about you behind your back.When you try cooking an omelette for breakfast and fail.When you go through an entire day of school without talking to a single person.When you go to work and spend four, six, right hours fantasizing about how you'd want to be anywhere else.When you pick up your pencil to draw, and the only thing that comes out of your hand is gibberish.When you sit down to do your homework and spend an hour on a single quick assignment.When you don't even have enough energy to sit down and play a videogame: your fingers won't move.When you go to bed and you won't fall asleep.When you go three hours over your bedtime, take a sleeping pill, go another three hours without sleep, spend two hours on the computer because it's too late to sleep, have your breakfast and go to school because it's too dangerous to skip, fall asleep during class and be mocked and scolded, go back home where you won't fall asleep, somehow manage to fall asleep at a reasonable hour later in the day after not doing any work, then wake up an hour after your first morning class starts.That kind of life that slowly eliminates your will to live completely. Why is it in my best interest to go with it?Is it gonna get better? For sure. Hell, my life is so much better now than it used to be. But I still don't feel like I wanna live. Maybe I'll never do. Maybe the bad things about life are so much more powerful to me than the good things, it's just not worth it for me to go on.And yet this completely rational desire is written off as the irrational will of somebody too preoccupied with the minute to realize the actual, objective value of the good life that he should be living.Nobody will support me, not after I've described to them how much I really don't want to be here. And that's understandable. Nobody wants to see their friend, boyfriend, son, team member disappear from the face of the Earth.But I think I have the right to decide on my own desires too.It's not a whim, people. It's life slowly scratching off any will I'd possibly have to continue living.People will look at me from the outside and think: What is this guy going on about? He has everything! He's going to a good school, he has loving parents that care for him, he has food on his plate everyday for God's sake.And all of that is true. And I wish I wouldn't take all of these things for granted and they gave me the will I need to keep going. But I can't.So, I don't want to keep going. This is my wish. It's not unfounded, it's not irrational. Why will nobody respect it?Dunno if I'll come back to check any replies, just needed to rant for a bit. Sorry about my English as it's my second language.",

But during the attempts and the contemplation, I remember my time going into mental health facilities such as group homes and psychiatric hospitals. But this is only because what everyone says; if you're having those thoughts you should get help. I've tried but it never seems to go the way everyone says it should. I won't go into details but, in terms of pediatric psyciatric facilities, everyone I know who's been in one has had nothing but bad experiences from what I hear. I've been in them too. And i wish I can say differently, but I've really had nothing but bad experiences from going to them and expecting to get better. In fact I'm pretty sure the last time I've been to one it's actually made me worse. Maybe it's just because the one meant for kids doesn't give as much liberty as the ones meant for adults, which kinda sucks. Onto my main point; Recently I've tried to hurt myself in some way, and afterwards I knew I needed help but since I've had such bad experiences I'm wondering if it's even worth it? Has anyone who's gone to a children's mental health facility say genuinly that they've actually gotten help? Is it worth the hospital fees and constant pressure by the adults supervising you? Is it worth being forced to socialize with strangers and pushed to talk about your feelings? Is it worth the first few nights of crying yourself to sleep wondering what went wrong?",

      "text": "I think I've been ready to die for a very, very long time. I can remember a time, back when I was 12 years old, and I was watching \"The 4400\" with my mom and older brother. There was this episode (I'm sorry I can't be more specific, it was a decade back) where people had created a ���shot' that could be given to ���normals' ��� and they had exactly a 50/50 shot if either getting superpowers, or dropping dead. Both my mother and brother debated while the credits rolled, each determining that, even for the chance at getting some amazing powers, they wouldn't want to risk losing their lives. I said something along the lines of ���But it's a win wither way! You can either join the 4400, or you don't have to live anymore.�۝ . . . I still remember the looks on their faces. I think it was the first time I started to think of myself as a freak.I'm 23 years old. And I fucking hate myself. I think all people are inherently valuable from that which they bring into the world and people around them. How does one measure a person? By their impact. And for as long as I can remember, i have found myself lacking. I am truly ugly, a round face and dank hair and a potato of a body that trips and stumbles and brushes into other people without their consent or desire. I'm weak, emotionally and physically ��� couldn't fight to save my life, and wouldn't have the strength of mind to do it anyhow. I'm manipulative ��� so many people look at me and think that I am a good, sweet thing that only smiles and offers lame jokes and loves life, when in fact I detest living with every particle of my being, and am able to fool everyone I know just by acting like anything matters to me, when I am in fact growing more and more certain that nothin, nothing, NOTHING does at all. I've always unerringly thought myself a fine actress ��� and the fact that no one around me known enough of my turmoil to think that my jokes about ���can't wait to die' might just be real really proves it. I'm stupid, and in a field where I will never bring discernible contribution to the world around me, other than serving people who, like myself, don't give a shit about me. I'm sick and twisted and lost in memories and half-fucking-crazy; I am a liar and a thief and some diet-form of a sociopath. I'm Grayson, and I hate myself. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, killing myself wouldn't be the best idea. I tried telling myself all of the usual things; my job will need me, my family will be devastated, my friends will miss me, there are so many things to look forward to, it gets better . . . white noise in my ears, anymore. My job doesn't need me. I love what I do, and once imagined myself doing it forever . . . But let's face it, it doesn't take a genius to check people into a hotel, or manage budgets, or plan parties. I see coworkers getting promoted all around me, with less experience and less time in the industry and less (or no) education, and it just reinforces to me, over and over and over again, that I''m not really hot shit at my job; I'm not going to do anything amazing, or make waves . . . I'll just be in my entry-level position for another three years, working my ass off and still just not being good enough ��� because desire and ambition don't make it in this world ��� connections and talent do. Neither of which I have. I am at the point where I have managed to convince myself that my family would understand why I did whatever it is I am going to do; my father was once suicidal, and he survived by the skin of his teeth . . . and made a change for the better in his life. And then he had my siblings, and spawned me into this world. I was never a very good daughter, the kind that my mother wanted and needed . . . but my little sister is there to help her through any loss she might feel in my death . . . And god, my little sister; she's perfect, beautiful and smart and kind and funny and hard-working . . . She's going places, and we all take pride in her every move; I like to think that she would be understanding about what happened, maybe a little sad, but knowing that I am worth more to a world I am not in than one I am consistently fucking up. My older brother doesn't even know me anymore, hasn't been interested in me for a long, long time. My little brother . . . well, we love eachother, but he's a very sensible person, logical almost to a fault; he can understand that there is no point in living if you're not going to do anything worthwhile with the gift you've been given. Truthfully, I think that the only ones I have any doubts about are my niece and nephew ��� I love the hell out of them; but they are so very young, sweet and impressionable and innocent . . . When I'm gone, it'll only take a few years before they forget Auntie Grayson, and it will be better that way. Life is always better without me. I have three best friends in the world. One of them uses me, clearly and obviously, because I gratify her need for attention. I'd be of better use to her dead, because then she can revel in being the mourning friend of that dead girl. My second best friend is a strong woman, married and independent and tough as nails; she was fine before I came into her life, and she'll be fine long after I'm gone. My last best friend, my oldest and most important . . . Well, about a year ago, she booted me our of her life, and told me she was better with me gone ��� and really, she was . . . the minute I was gone, she found a better job, managed to get engaged, and bought a house. We're friends again, now, had a weepy reunion and all that bullshit, but there's a hollowness there that was never acknowledged before. I mean, she clearly excelled when I was driven from her life; me ducking out now can only help her further. I am a bad person. I am toxic and shallow and wrong. I wish, sometimes, that someone would come and just beat the shit out of me so I could feel as if, maybe, just a little bit, I am making headway on the punishment I need . . . but I've been (un)lucky enough to avoid anything akin to that.I've started to realize that life doesn't get better. I am 23 years old, have a good job and a boyfriend of more than a year that I love, I am almost done with schooling . . . And I feel nothing. I Google ���is it okay to want to die�۝ and ���why is my presence a blight upon this world.�۝ I drink sometimes, and it helps me sleep; I take burning hot showers because the tingles on my skin make me feel like someone is toughing me, like maybe I am being held, and sub sequentially held back . . . But nothing. I keep trying to rationalize my existence, I believe that everything happens for a reason . . . And I have done SOME good in my life, a drop in the bucket . . . but there's really nothing more I can contribute to anyone, and I feel like my death is the next step. What is the point in hanging around if my purpose has been fulfilled? And, more to the point, my life ending would benefit the people I care about a good great deal; my family and friends would receive the benefit of my years of savings and frugality, my brother would have a completely paid-for apartment for another year, and all of my clothes and things could go to people who would actually appreciate them, to people who need them and want them and care. Some people, I think, just aren't meant to be alive. Some of us are mistakes ��� and we need to correct mistakes. I think I've made up my mind to kill myself. It is not because I've had a bad life, or because anyone pushed me into it. For once, this is something I'm doing all on my own, and for once, it is something good. I feel so at peace, knowing that I finally made a choice. I don't know when or how (though I imagine soon, and I hope with a gun). I've had a living will and a life insurance policy for some time, and all I really need to do is decide whether or not to leave a note. I don't think I will. I don't want people to remember me. I'm not sharing this to get advice or people telling me not to do it. I just wanted to be honest, just this one time, and tell someone what I am really thinking, what I am really feeling. And God, do I feel light. . . .Thank you for your time. Better luck next time.",

It all started in 2012 when was created. A place that provides a spoiler-free environment to catch up on esports events on Reddit. It turned out successful because we started covering CS:GO (), Dota 2 (), and Overwatch () after that (and even gave Call of Duty and Hearthstone a try). The subreddits offer easy-to-find information and direct links to picks & bans, game start and highlights. To be spoiler-free we simulate matches, meaning we add game 4 an hour after game 3 ends, even when the match turned out 3-0. Tiebreakers? We add an extra table which will contain the maximum number of tiebreakers. Even when there was none played.We even created a Chrome and Firefox extension that hides comments and related videos on YouTube.Basically, to really prevent spoilers people need to do a lot. Aside from dodging social media, friends and sometimes the client, you need the subreddit’s stylesheet turned on and our fancy extension.Subreddits have a lot of caps and limits, so we wanted our own stand-alone website. A website that basically does what our subreddits do, but easier, quicker and without the external hassle.Like any website, we aren’t done yet. On the agenda are email and desktop notifications, so you never miss another game. Another feature we’re working on is making sure you can customize the settings to match your viewing experience.

I was in debt and I concealed it for the entirety of our relationship. Out of fear. I'm a fucking liar. So I've reached this milestone age, and I'm newly single. I have nowhere to live. I'm bankrupt. I'm friendless. I have nothing. I get up in the morning, I go to work, I come home and I'm alone. I don't know what has compelled me to write this down. Maybe it's an exercise in catharsis.

Just tired of everything.When it's looked out of context, it doesn't seem too bad, but hear me out...it won't be that thrilling really, but it's just tiringIt was raining today as I was driving (in my mom's car {important for later}) home, I stopped at the traffic light and this guy behind me in his truck slammed into me. Luckily it wasn't too bad, but I exchanged some details and tried tone up as much as I could because he seemed shady.I insist that we go to the police station to get a case number etc etc. He agrees , and we go. Once we arrive at the police station he begs me to not involve the police because his boss is going to come down on him heavy, and his job is under scrutiny...Now I'm standing there, thinking, the world gives me such shit, and here I have the opportunity to just make this guy's life a little better, maybe safer too because heck, we need our jobs to survive. Yet on the other hand, it's my mother's car, and she would do things the civil way. I choose to take his details and not involve the police because why not, I am trying to be the better/nicer person, coz what you put in is what you get out right?? Not really I guess..I get home , I get a scolding, and I'm an adult, yeah totally normal, coz these things don't happen when people drive behind you in the rain . Gah. Hopefully the insurance sorts this out, but it's going to be a real pain.Fastforward 3 hours of crashing coz it was the only thing I could do while stressed.I can't find my flash drive with all my important documents on. It's these small things that pile up and just beautifully spreads the shit flavored icing on a garbage cake.Night time I'm forced to visit some family with the ugly dent in the car that my parents worked quite hard for, but only to be greeted with a congregation of my family too busy admiring this brand new sports car in the driveway.Who's new car is this? Oh, it's my cousin with the rich parents. So much years younger than me, has had a more blessed life than me. Then you have to fake smile your way into congratulating him all night and fake admiring what a beautiful car it is. You just don't smile, and you become transparent and they start speaking how jealous you are without saying a word. Amazing how humans are with their interactions. I'm really just tired, but I beat through the night and fake smiled anyways.I should give more context on this said cousin but I'm too tired, so long story short, he is an asshole and we'll leave it at thatNow to think that I am out here reaching, doing what I must, trying to be nice, and life hands you this? Hell, it doesn't even hand it to you? It constantly smacks you with it. Why bother? It's really just all too much. I understand it isn't fair, but rising through this is really tiring. Just tiring.~kinda my second post, I don't know what I'm doing on here or Reddit . So go soft. It feels nice to speak all this out I guessI'm not sure if this even the correct subreddit to post this, but I'll leave it hear anyways",

I am facing a felony charge over a completely exaggerated and not even criminal let alone felonious situation. I have gained back all the weight I've lost in high school. I'm working a shit job with shit pay and this pending criminal record is preventing me from finding something career-worthy with the bachelors degree I literally just got in May. My girlfriend of over 2 years just told me she wants a break. I kinda saw it coming, but I'm not sure if she wants to break up with me or not. My father is having health problems and it's really hard to watch. I'm scared for him. But mostly, I'm scared for myself. Every single day I think about suicide, but I know I wouldn't do it because I don't want to hurt anyone. One of my best friends roommate just committed suicide and my friend found her and seeing what she is going through is awful and I would never want to put that pain on anyone else. I know that I won't actually do it. But the bullshit keeps piling up. I also just got a $275 ticket (unlawful spedometer...the fuck) after just paying off a $400 one from a stupid speeding ticket last year. I hardly make enough money to pay those. And don't even get me started with the cost of my lawyer...I just feel like I went from being a happy, chill, go with the flow person to this extremely devastated, upset and depressed person. I know that some of my friends have been worried about me. And I have all the support in the world...but theres only so many times you can cry about your problems to people before you need a different perspective. I need help.",

I always think I get better but don't. I haven't had healthy friendships or relationships in ages. I lost my identity because I let my parents control and make decisions for me.For example at Christmas when my extended family asks me what I've been up to my mom buts in and starts talking on my behalf. Currently seeing a therapist, but my therapist isn't helpful. I use my mom to vent about boys and life especially in college. But in reality she uses me to vicariously live her failed dreams.I tell her too much about work and she acts like she knows my coworkers and bosses when she never met them. She likes to assure my life is great working minimum wage in retail as a college graduate, when in reality it's not.She tells me my boss is great because he underschedules me but gives me hours later. Yet I'm making minimum wage on call.She plays the at least you're not like the people in Africa, Europe, or Hurricane Harvey card. She didn't believe in my anxiety and depression until my cousin got treated for mental illness a year ago.She likes to deny and be passive aggressive. She pretends to apologize but not sincerely. She blames how I don't respect me yet she doesn't respect me or my remaining family.I constantly go back for her for support when I don't need to. I like to talk about my life because I LOVE venting. I journal and rant personally to myself (even with my plushies) but it's not enough because I stopped talking with my friends two years ago because she didn't want me to drive 90 minutes to see my close friends. (Since I don't have my own car but now they let me use their car for work.)She tells me which guys to date. For example my ex was blondish and she wanted me to date brunettes because she's attracted to them.I don't know why I'm worthless enough to have her want to control me. I'm nothing special.When I put myself down she's personally offended. Do you know why? Because she see's me as an extension or herself, so I'm essentially putting herself down.I'm taking steps to improve myself and going to therapy, but it's taking TIME.Sometimes I want to end my life because of codependent relationship with NMom. Working on improving myself to get better job so I can move out. 25F in a codependent and emotionally abusive dynamic between parents. Mom vicariously lives through me and I constantly talk about her with strangers. Trying to move out but I don't want to this year. Help?",

      "text": "I don't think I'm your typical depressed person. Or maybe I am and just don't realize it. I've been very depressed since I was about 16, I'm now 25. I don't have the support system I wish I did and I don't have the money for a therapist. I drink, smoke weed, and take prescription pills to cope.(I don't buy these things my boyfriend does and I just take them because I'm the worst person on the planet) So I guess I'll start with the reasons I think I'm so depressed. When I was 16 I had what I thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents. Until the day my dad left my mom. It was totally unwarranted. I even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke. NOT A JOKE. Fast forward to now. I found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years. My mom knew nothing. My parents \"friends\" decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final. Being sixteen and going through that was hell for me. I remember trying to cut myself but I was too scared to cut too deep. All I ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist. Real edgy. Anyways, so I've also been in love with someone for eh 9 years. The problem being this person lives in a different country. He had no intention of moving to the states(can't say I blame him). And to be honest if I were to move there I don't think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently . He tells me loves me from time to time but that's easy to say when you know you'll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that. So just about every year-two years I skip from relationship to relationship. I think So I don't get attached. I dk but it's really hard on me mentally and it's even harder because I don't truly understand why I do it.Okay so fast forward to last December. I found out I was pregnant. It was a weird feeling. I was so overjoyed I think because I thought it would give me purpose. I had just started a new job and didn't want to tell them immediately so I hid it from them. It was hard to schedule the necessary appointments that way though. One morning I woke up at 3am with horrible cramps. I didn't fall back asleep. I was getting up and around for work at 6 and I was spotting so I called into work. I told them I thought it was an ovarian cyst. When I got to the hospital everyone was really nice(I think they already knew what was going on). Fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours. I found out that the fetus inside me was dead. Who knows how long I had been carrying that thing inside of me dead. They gave me my options and I told them I would think about them, make a few calls to my insurance provider, and let them know tomorrow. They sent me on my way. At 6pm that night I had a miscarriage in my bed. It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced . Now I'm pretty traumatized. I mentally can't have sex anymore and it's been putting a huge strain on my relationship.So, I bought a gun. My boyfriend thinks it's because I want to practice shooting. The real reason I bought it was because I figured that would be the easiest way for me to kill myself. The problem is i'm not afraid of death. I could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now. The other problem is that I am an empath and I know killing myself would hurt a lot of people. It's not their fault they don't understand how much pain I'm in. I've tried to explain but they just tell me in sad and it will pass or maybe I should get some help. Well it's really fucking difficult to get help when I'm barely paying my car payment, car insurance, phone bill, and rent. Plus gas for the hour to and from work ride I have m-f. So I guess I should explain how my title is involved. A few days ago I found out someone I graduated high school with committed suicide. My family has known his family forever but we weren't ever really friends. I found myself crying all day long over this person I was never friends with. I realized I was crying because I was envious. I wanted the courage he had to go through with it. I really don't want to be here anymore but I don't know how to turn my conscience off to go though with it.I don't know what to do anymore. All I think about is killing myself. I want it so bad. I don't know if I'll ever have the balls to do it or not. But thanks for reading anyways. And if anyone has any advice or anything to share I'd love to hear it.",

My mom wont even let me ask the doctors about it. And she wont listen to reason. She says hrt will makeme violent and depressed and its a phase and idk what i really want. Ive been wanting T for at LEAST three years now. Yeah my hair is short and i dress as andro as i can, but im misgendered constantly. Knowing that my mom knows and still wont make an effort to help me (even pronoun wise) feels awful. And the fact that my boyfriend says he'll always see me as more feminine bc we have sex makes me want to cut off my skin. (Otherwise hes chill with me being trans). At least my therapist is trying to talk sense into my mom but i feel hopeless. Whats the point if i have to wait years and years to be able to really be myself? Whats the point in living if im constantly uncomfortable and want to curl up inside myself?",

I've just finished Brideshead Revisited and I'm having a hard time seeing how the novel is pro-Catholic or pro-aristocracy. I don't understand how Waugh's portrayal of religion is supposed to make a case for it and from my point of view the novel shows aristocracy as a crumbling relic but doesn't really glorify it. I've read that Waugh meant for the novel to portray each character's personal form of religious redemption but I fail to see how this occurs. Could someone enlighten me? I loved the novel for its gorgeous prose and portrayal of decay, but the last chapter/epilogue have me a bit lost.I'm a cultural historian who just graduated from a masters program, which means I haven't read for fun in a very, very long time. I also focus on music and visual media, so I haven't analyzed literature in a while. I love gorgeous prose, but I find that I miss major themes pretty easily, so I'd love some help here. Thanks!",

      "text": "Just started highschool and my suicidal thoughts are coming back already I just want to get this off my chest...so yeah here we goI have always been a kid with bad thoughts and suicide has bothered me since i was 10,so there's no need to say i'm a pretty fucked up person. I attempted suicide loads of times,the first was when i was 11,i just started middle school and everyone there was so bad,they kept insulting me and leaving me alone,but everything changed at the end of middle school. No need to say the situation got better,because we slowly grew and everyone started treating me nicely,and one day my \"bully\" (not really a bully,but you get the idea) apologized! and i was so happy that i forgot about suicide and i just had happiness in my mind for the rest of the year. Then i went to high school and i had to leave everyone behind. I wasn't sad,of course i wanted them back,but i thought changing would have been nice,of course it wasn't.So there's me,and i'm on my way for the first day of high school,no need to say i was a bit anxious,but mostly exited. So i get in my class and every teacher told us their names and we started meeting our teachers and our future class mates,everyone seemed nice and i was happy. Of course i'm not writing in a subreddit called SuicideWatch for no reason,so here's where it got crazy. So far one week has passed and we met all the teachers,just the physics one was missing. To start off,the \"english\" teacher (i'm not english,i mean the teacher that teaches my language)that seemed sooo nice at the start,turned out to be a fucking nightmare. The math teacher was,no need to say it,an even worse fucking nightmare and to finish off,theese are my plans for all the weeks of all the months of all theese 5 fucking years of my life.MONDAY Study Math,from the things we did from the start of the year to the day we left,study Science,from the things we did from the start of the year,to the day we left. Study history,with the same criteria and english.TUESDAY Study for the test that the math teacher gives us every tuesday and study science and chemestryDo i need to go on? every day is like this and i seriously can't fucking take it anymore,i study HARD every single day,it's been 1 month and everything i did was study and crying when i'm about to fall asleep. I haven't gone out with my friends,haven't had even a tiny bit of fun and my grades are really bad. And you now what pretty much all the teachers say when they give me a bad grade? YOU HAVEN'T STUDIED ENOUGH Now 2 month passed and i still haven't been able to smile. Is it me?Am i really this much of a failure?I'm not going to spend 5 years of my life studying to then study more for another 5 years or so,and then working and paying bills until i dieSo tell me please,because if this is reality i'm never going to accept it,i'll just be a coward and put a knife inside my neck because i won't waste my life like this.sorry for any typos,but i'm too tired to check and english is not my main launguage anyways--This is a temporary account,so i won't be responding after half an hour or so-- Thanks.",

I'm not homeless anymore, I volunteer, I go to disabled people groups for people like me with chronic pain and mobility issues, I'm getting a therapy animal, I work on two different therapy tactics to gain control over my various disorders. Yet I truly died early January, I broke over and over, I went into psychotic episodes, I lost reality, I lost my home after a pretty bad chain reaction break up (SO cheating, finding out I was pregnant, a miscarriage, having to leave the property we had,him taking all the furniture)a person I'm still in love with and a healthy body combined with a lot of mind games, lies and constant pressure from other people that just kept pushing me over the edge. I'm just a difficult worthless and unlovable person. I developed pneumonia twice, various viral infections, A womb that's damaged and my chronic pain got worse. I had many trips to the hospital during my five months homelessness, I got briefly stalked and attacked by a man in a night shelter I was staying at, I began ignoring my pain level and forcing myself out everyday, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I refused my medications, I was constantly anxious and having panic attacks daily. I got addicted to sleeping pills for a while, if anything just not to remember and just not have to face reality. I got my home two months ago, I saved every penny I had during my homeless time and bought new furniture, decorated, a disability bed etc and have disability functions installed within so I don't get so tired. Yet for the life of me. I still wake up everyday, empty, cold, wishing I was dead, wishing I did die, I stopped speaking, my friends and siblings only wanted a house to use, money to borrow, a hotel with free wifi. Forever showing up uninvited, triggering ptsd and anxiety with constant knocking multiple times a day despite my protests of not wanting anyone near me or telling them I'm out or not answering the door, they didn't care. No one cared or checked in if I went off the radar for weeks unless I could do them favours. I run but nothing stops it. Nothing eases the memories or the pain, or the ache you feel when someone you loved isn't there anymore. How you miss them so badly your teeth ache, your chest hurts, your head replays all the best and the worst parts in your head. Knowing you're not good enough for the world, for friendships, for life, for family that only check in to borrow money, knowing it was all your fault, you're the toxic, ugly, evil person and no amount of remorse or guilt you feel can fix it. I forced myself to change and be healthy but I'm just an empty shell, a damaged doll with an expiry date. I tried to do good with false hope it'd eventually get better but nothing changes how it feels, nothing is going to make people care or my dad to love me, or for people to come back, to notice and miss me if I disappear.I'm already a ghost, I just wish I had the courage to finally end it.",

It and it's following successors, \"Reign of Madness\" and \"Legends of Ahn,\" take you on a massively interesting journey. A brief summary of the first part of the first book (Spoilers obviously): Rezkin grew up in a fortress, learning the Skills and Rules, not only learning, but mastering them. He finishes mastering all the Skills at the age of 19. His master's order him to kill all of his teachers. He follows the Rules and obeys his masters who duel eachother to the death as he kills 15/16 of the Strikers who trained him, one managing to escape by avoiding the combat. He then receives the first two Rules from his dying master. Aiming to follow his Rules, he sets out after Striker Farson. This sets him on a path that leads to intrigue and adventure. 9/10 would recommend the whole series, book 4 is set to come out in 2018. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.",

I grew up with some pretty bad situations the only good thing being my mom and some of my siblings. But every second since birth has been the worst pain i've experienced I never was regularly happy and don't see that changing ever. I am only going to college part time and work a little over part time but I am falling behind in my classes and I always make the stupidest mistakes at work that make my managers made at me I i'm terrified of going to full time but know I eventually will have to and I know it will get so much worse. The stress from school is crippling since I never really went to school and have mental illness that makes it impossible to get school work done, It's so much to even think about homework that doing so makes me depressed and I start hitting myself just to alleviate the mental hell in my head. Going on my current course I will get my bachelors in 8 years 8 fucking years of hell to survive just so I can maybe get a job in my field. But I already know that I may get fired from work because of my mental problems and that's not going to change so I don't know how I will ever work and hold down the same job. Even if I finish school I can not see myself not even enjoying life but even being able to tolerate living it will be constant hell just to live everyday. I'm on my own in a state that hates gays it took forever to even admit to myself that I am attracted to men at almost 20 years old I know it could be much worse I could be in a country that makes it illegal but it still hurts to be so scared to be open and find love. I want to be with someone as physical touch since birth besides my mom's has been full of violence and hurt never loving even hugs have been extremely rare I remember I hugged my mom a couple years ago when I got my ged and that was the first hug in years i'm honestly even considering going onto craigslist to find someone who just wants to fuck even though I know it would probably make me more depressed to give up my virginity to someone i'm not series about just to get some physical loving contact. I hate myself and know i'll always be a failure at everything due partially to my mental problems. I want to kill myself so bad just to get rid of the stress the responsibility that creates such a horrible living hell in my head. I constantly fantasize about getting killed just so my mom wouldn't be disappointed in my suicide. I can't and won't ever be ready and able to handle adult life and nothing can change that i've tried the meds but they just made things worse. I'm so fucking scared i'm scared to be alone in this state without my mom i'm scared to be working and going to school knowing i'm failing at both. And i'm scared because I know it will not get better it will just get worse. I'm sorry my thoughts are jumbled and it probably doesn't make too much sense or that it sounds whiny i'm just really scared and don't know what to do so I thought talking to at least someone even online would help even a tiny bit.",

Feel free to ask any additional questions if you honestly even care.Long story short I just want to die nothing has become better in my life and it won't ever become better.(if I had to give an example of my daily thought process it would season 4 episode 6 of Bojack horseman except the getting drunk part)Thanks for reading I guess.",

This is a post global warming dystopian fiction. one of my favorites of late.The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood. I wanted to read this before I watched the Hulu series. I still haven't watched it. I wonder if it's any good.Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Phillip K. Dick. I enjoyed this book, but it took a while to grab my interest.Kings and Sorceres books 1-6 by Megan Rice. Would not recommend this series, but I had to finish what I started. The first few books are decent.A Natural History of Dragons by Marie Brennan. This book is quite unique. It's a book about an author writing a book about dragons and their characteristics. No action and kind of boring, but unique.Call of Cthulu and Other Weird Stories by H.P. Lovecraft.

      "text": "John dies At The End is the first book I've ever enjoyed reading after I've seen the movie I've got a pretty terrible attention span. I love reading and watching movies, but once I know what happens I'm usually unable to sit myself through a second reading of a book because even years later it jogs my memories and I feel like I could be utilizing that time doing something else. Reading a full book can be a pretty big time commitment, after all.I usually sit myself down to read a book before the movie (if possible) for that reason. I know I'll usually enjoy the book more and if I know what's going to happen it probably will lose my interest throughout as it hashes out the parts the movie already has.But recently I found out John Dies At The End, a movie I only watched because it was on Netflix and I didn't feel like searching through for anything else (turned out I loved that movie) was based off book one of a three part trilogy.I bought the set and decided to try and read the first, expecting I'd wasted my money...What gripped me first was how scene for scene the movie had stayed true to the book. I hadn't noticed how narration heavy the movie was until reading large portions of the book. I was truly impressed that they kept such a faithful rendition.Then I got to about 40% into the book and the movie finally veered off on its own. I haven't finished reading it yet, but as far in as I am I assume they merely cut out part of the adventure for the sake of screen time. There's things happening now that are tied into the movie much earlier and had an impact at the movies end, so I believe I'll catch up to the movies last scenes as I continue reading.But I thought I'd share/recommend this to everyone who hasn't read the book but enjoyed the movie. The book still managed to keep me interested long enough for me to get into a whole part of the adventure I never would've read otherwise, and now I'm enjoying this part as if I'm enjoying the story for the first time!",

Hey all,I've been having financial problems for the past 7 years or so and it's not because I'm financially undisciplined, in fact I'm frugal and smart about my money. I have terrible luck with employment (only ever had 1 full time job) and I am trying to save money to finish college. I have 3 courses left to finish college and get my bachelor's degree but the lack of it is heavily impeding my chances of holding a steady job that pays me enough to pay my student loans as well as save money for college.Due to this, I resorted to freelancing. It's been great, I've made some money but this financial problem is also with my family and whatever I earned I helped them and I paid my student loan that's due every month. But freelancing is volatile and right now I have an employer who will potentially give me projects but he needs to wait for his clients to pay him. Honestly at this point, I'm fully expecting it to fizzle out because life always finds a way to fuck me anyway.I blame nobody but myself. The path I've gone down has been hard and I could have chosen the easier path, but I made mistakes. All I want is to be able to earn a steadier income to help me build my life but life is just obstructing my path. If this project doesn't come through I'm back to square one and I feel like I should kill myself because I'm running out of energy to even handle this anymore. I'm lost and my mistakes have made a heavy impact on my family and myself. Why bother living if I consistently get fucked over no matter how hard I work and if I just caused burden and hardship to my family and myself? Fuck this life.Also, I don't have any issues with self esteem, women, etc. I'm a pretty normal person and I only need a damn job and money to get me out of this rut. I'm willing to sacrifice a limb or a couple of limbs if it means getting me out of this, honestly.",

Now, running is probably the best exercise to listen to audio books while doing, but it's always been difficult to me to get into audio books. My mom never read books to me as far as I can remember, and I get distracted VERY easily when listening to audiobooks. I've tried while ironing, making food, taking a walk, but it simply doesn't work out. I get distracted, I lose the thread, I sometimes find it difficult to understand what's being said (might be an ear issue).I'd still like to try running with an audiobook to save time/use time (because if I have a choice, I'll always pick books over sport), and I was wondering whether anyone experiences this too and what you do about it!

      "text": "Slaughterhouse 5- PTSD vs “unstuck in time” Started slaughterhouse 5. On chapter 5, and I fucking love it so far. Already spent hours on hours in my head on the topic of existentialism and all the stuff that Vonnegut packed into this amazing novel.Anyways, I wanted to see what others thought of the book, so I came to reddit. Apparently, there is a major debate between Billy’s experiences being the result of PTSD vs Billy actually becoming unstuck in time, like in the literal sense. In almost every thread for this book I see people arguing over this conflict. So, I’d like to add my argument.I’m completely on the side of Billy not having a mental disorder. I think he actually became unstuck in time, and I think him being unstuck in time attests to the Tralfamadorian concept of consciousness being the driving factor behind rationalizing “reality”. Billy’s consciousness is split into multiple timelines, and his consciousness’s occupation of multiple realities provides him with a glimpse of the way the Tralfamadorians view time. Not to say that he views time like the Tralfamadorians, but that he starts to time in the way that the aliens it. Whether or not he actually met the Tralfamadorians or if he came up with them to justify his split in existence is irrelevant, I feel, as that was pretty much Vonnegut’s point. whether or not Billy actually met the aliens, what matters is that he he did, which allows him to feel comfortable with his position in the universe. I feel like Vonnegut’s whole purpose of this book was (besides the anti war parallels with PTSD, which i think do exist, just aren’t the direct explanation of Billy’s story, more of an interpretation of Vonnegut’s experiences) to try and describe the way we subscribe ourselves to certain narratives we encounter, and how in doing so we’ll rationalize anything, as long as it gives our lives a sense of direction. This is where I feel like Vonnegut’s obvious criticism of organized religion is shown off, as he satirizes it as a rationalization of the universe that’s been so normalized that it ends up placing hoards of people in a completely stagnant position for the rest of their lives. The main examples of this idea this were the Kilgore Trout story of the Old Testament, New Testament, and the Persecution of Christ, and the characterization of Billy as a priests assistant(?) in the war.My main argument for the idea of Billy actually being unstuck in time rather than having a mental disorder, though, is that the story can’t make sense if the explanation is the latter. In chapter 1, Vonnegut explains that Billy’s life in the time of war, at the very least, did happen (in a fictional sense, obviously). This means that Billy’s timeline at least up until he wanders to the latrine where he sees the POW’s shitting their brains out is what actually happened. Before that point, though, is the scene where Billy is captured by the Germans, and thrown into shrubbery in order to elicit a response to be used by the media. However, billy comes out smiling, because he’s unstuck in time, and his consciousness has split into the future. This means that his being unstuck in time has a direct impact on his actions in “real time”, which PTSD wouldn’t be able to explain, as PTSD would have to be him looking back on his life, not forward to events that haven’t even happened yet. It’s just not possible for PTSD to be the case. However, I don’t think Vonnegut was trying to say that the future is predictable, so I feel like the future that Billy looks into never actually happens/happened(?) past a certain point, so it’s probably explained near the end that he died somewhere in the middle, or something. If that’s actually what happens i’ll be pretty proud of myself lolBut yeah, that’s my point of view on the whole mental disorder vs unstuck in time thing. Sorry about how messy all that was, or if it read like an AP Literature free response, or if i overly explained obvious ideas like a dumbass lmao. It’s 2am and i wanted to put my ideas down somewhere that other people could see them. What’s yalls take on the argument?",

I made a comment that my first pay check, ever in my life, I wanna spend it on whatever I want. This mutual friend says, \"that's rude and disrespectful to your mother.\" I never ever have been able to spend my own money on anything because I've never had my own money... I just wanted to buy something for myself.. I feel like a piece of shit... I probably won't kill myself. But my body aches like it's begging me to end it all...

They've spent their entire life trying extremely hard to help me in every way, but I've come to think it's just not possible for me to pay them back no matter what I do. If I knew my death wouldn't devastate them I would be hanging right now. I know how to tie two knots like the back of my hands: my shoelaces and a goddamn noose.But I'm too rational a person to mill myself. And I owe too much to kill myself. And I'll go to hell if I kill myself. But every day I can feel I am slipping a little closer. I'm getting a little less sane, a little less smart, and a little less rational every day. I have tried being open about it. Nobody knows how to help me, and I ended up feeling worse for upsetting them. As for a therapist? I had one. She was really helpful, but the first antidepressants had me feeling apathetic, so she switched me to a different medication that ended up making me suicidal (even more than I am now). I was going to swallow all of the pills I could find, but I barely stopped myself and messaged her and my family. The result: she abandoned me because she didn't want to take responsibility. I am sitting here with a noose I tied. I don't have anywhere private and strong enough to hang it, and perhaps not enough intent to hang myself. But as it's going, I am getting closer and closer. I just want it to be quick, painless, and clean; these three things are the only things stopping me when I have a seriously bad episode. I know I sound incoherent. I said I have only one reason but I don't even know anymore. All I know is that when it comes down to it, there's just a tiny fine line stopping me when it gets bad. And every time it gets bad that line gets tinier and finer. I don't know when it will snap. But if this doesn't stop, it snapping is guaranteed.",

      "text": "I'm 16... I don't want to live anymore I made this account just so I can share my story I need some comforting as I sit here writing this tears roll down my eyes, thoughts running through my head thinking is there really any point living anymore? I am turning 17 next month but I don't want to be here anymore. I have extreme anxiety and depression and I try to hide it away from everyone, I keep everything to myself and shy and embarrassed to tell anyone. Due to my anxiety I pushed everyone away I lost my best friend of 14 years and all my other friends so now I have none, my mum and dad are not really supportive about my anxiety and don't understand, I feel like they don't love or care about me, my little brother treats me like shit and I don't really see my older sister as she lives far away from me. I have no cousins that I can even hang with as they don't live in the same country as me, my mums side of the family live in different countries and my dad side of the family live far away from us. At 14 I had a 2 year relationship when I thought I was really in love and found my future husband ( I know sounds stupid at such a young age but I guess that's why... I was so young to know anything about love) to who I lost my virginity to, where I was mentally and physically abused and hit and threatened and controlled and cussed for the last months of the relationship, everyone was telling me to leave him all my friends, my sister, my mum, even my school teachers but I didn't listen to them and I chose to find the good in this toxic person because I loved him but one day I finally had the strength and realised I deserved much better and left him because he was also cheating on me which left me heartbroken and which triggered my whole anxiety and depression and has left me as a broken person till this day, he also made out I was the bad person in the relationship and somehow he got everyone to believe him because everyone thinks that I did him wrong when I really didn't and they don't know what happened behind closed doors, but after that relationship I was so hurt so I kept meeting up with lots of boys with my friends and getting drunk and kissing and hugging lots of boys just to feel loved again but I would NEVER EVER let my broken heart lower my standards to go and have sex with these boys but rumours got spread by my ex and now people call me a \"hoe\" and all his friends (girls) see me on the streets and try to fight me or call me names. My parents have noticed I have changed and became such a angry, short tempered, unsociable person even my ex best friend kept telling me I had changed. I used to smoke I started with cigarettes and it lead to smoking weed all day everyday, I used to stay out until midnight also drinking alcohol, lying all over the roads and floors throwing up but also enjoying myself so much, the reason as to why I turnt to weed and alcohol is because it made me feel better about myself and made me feel more confident and I could be myself while I was high or drunk I felt happy funny, talkative,bubbly and so happy with life. I find it so upsetting how I have to take drugs to make me feel like myself, but I haven't drank or smoked in quite a while due to being inside my house all day which I think is making my illness worse. All I ever do now is sit in my room all day on my phone I only go downstairs to get my food and bring it back into my room to eat. I go to the hospital twice a week due to some problems I have but that's the only time I really step out of my house since I lost my best friend. The tiniest things can make me cry and hurt my feelings and I hate feeling this way I want to be strong and confident. I also feel fat, everyone tells me that I am slim and that I have a big bum, I have a flat stomach and that I have a beautiful face and all the boys go crazy for me but I just can't stop eating due to feeling upset all the time and being inside bored. My mum and dad don't ever get me anything anymore, they used to spoil me get me whatever I wanted and treat me so special until I changed and now I'm starting to think the way they treat me is my fault because of the way I am towards them, I feel like they only love my older sister and little brother and that I am the odd one out. There was always jokes made about me being found in a bin ( my siblings would say it when I was annoying them) but even though they are joking it makes me think maybe I was adopted due to not feeling loved as much as my siblings by my parents. I have to start college and everyone has already started whereas I have not even applied for one due to not wanting to go to any where I live because of all the people where I live screaming nasty things to me that my ex rumoured about me to everyone that even my ex best friends are joining in with it. I really wanna move house out of this place where I live but my parents don't want to move yet but the more and more I think about it there just gonna be everywhere so I had asked my mum if we can move country to where her family are but she said it would take at least 2 years and I can't wait that long. I also deleted all my social media due to being scared what everyone thinks of me or getting rude messages from anyone, I really want to do my course or apprenticeship and make some money for myself but I am too scared to go out and do it and meet new people!! What am I going to do :( my mum and dad don't understand they keep telling me off for it and saying I have no ambitions when I really do, today a education lady from the council came to my house to speak to me about college and further education and my mum told her about my anxiety, she is also someone that helps with anxiety and depression so I am going to have sessions with her and hopefully she can help me get better but I feel like this anxiety will never go away I've had it for years now... I've just had enough, I also used to cut my wrists but I stopped a year ago, something happened this year which made me do it again but that was the only time. I am even afraid to post this incase anyone hates on me but there's nothing I can do, I pray to god every night to make my life better and protect me I guess it's all up to him now because I really feel like leaving this life forever and I'm sure no one will care ...",

I'm depressed and using opiates/alcohol to cope with the stress of being homeless since I don't know any other way to cope. I recently just found out my mother is drinking again and she used to help me with my stress but now that's she's drinking again she is never home. I feel alone and the only thing I got left to at least help me cope is opiates and alcohol so obviously I relapsed after 1 month of being clean.

      "text": "I'm sorry this is the second time I'm writing here today. I think I just got pushed over the edge. I'm 16. I've been depressed since I was in 3rd grade. It was kind of in the back of my mind until 4th grade when I got hospitalized for the first time. I met this guy in 8th grade. He was my first boyfriend. He constantly mentally abused me and guilt tripped me into doing things that I wasn't ready for. I've never told anyone this before. I remember one day he called me Over to his dorm. He said he was gonna kill him self because I wasn't answering him. I went over and he was waiting at the door for me. He had a pair of scissors and he started cutting his hands up in front of me. Over the next few months he'd keep telling me I was useless and that He didn't know why he was still with me. Then one day he convinced me to in away from school with him. And I did. The police found us next day. I was in the hospital for the next 4 days because of hypothermia. That summer was the worst because I knew everything was my fault. It's been just over a year and a half since all of that. At the beginning of 9th grade I met a person. This person made me so happy. They helped me through everything. They loved me and I loved them. We were together for 6 months. Then last month they decided it of no where they didn't want me anymore. I told my friends about it and I kept saying I wanted to kill my self cause everytime I've kept everything inside I've ended up going through with plans. I'm just too stupid and they never work. I just end up in the emergency room (after the last attempt I have permanent liver damage). I'm putting my friends through too much. They spend too much time worrying about me. But I want to tell them what's happening with me and how I feel but if I do then they'll worry more. And if I'm gone then they won't worry at all cause they won't have to. I guess I'm writing here because I can't go to the people I actually want to talk to about myself. I'm just hoping someone reads this and might be able to help a little. Cause I don't wanna die. But at the same time I do more than anything else. And it's not like the feeling goes away. I'm afraid to die. But I want to die. I lost the most important person in my life last month. They'd stuck with me trough everything up until august. They stuck with me when I was was in the hospital after overdosing. They waited for me afterwards but now they're gone. They were the only person I felt comfortable going to whenever I was about to kill myself. I guess I just want someone to talk me out of it. Last time I tried to kill myself it was because nobody talked me out of it. It was because I didn't go to anyone about it. But now I have no one to go to. I just want to be happy again. What makes all of this shit worse is that I remember what it was like to be happy everyday and enjoy living. Being able to get out of bed. And now I'm sitting here everyday being yelled at by my parents. They keep saying \"what the fucks wrong with you why won't you get up. Is t that depression shit again? Just suck it up. Everyone gets sad but we all just suck it up. Go to school\" I can't go to school anymore. I just sit in the bathroom and try to cry silently so no one notices. Please someone respond. I want help. I know I'm going to do something tonight if I don't talk to someone.This post kinda elaborates on one of the issues I've been dealing with from my earlier post",

But what is wrong with these arguments is, that these people didn't really dwell in depression till that age. They built the foundation for their success till then, or learning other things and how to learn things or at least not getting brain damage I was shit at uni, due to laziness and depression and social anxiety. I really think, now I am doomed to live the like of a dumb person, and that I wasted my potential forever. That I cannot be great at socializing anymore, just less shit.

There's some kind of component missing - I can't connect to others and barely being able to speak to my co-workers today just smeared that point all in my face. I didn't even WANT to talk to them, I felt myself judging every part of them.

      "text": "Update on my life Old post: Hello, I am a 14 yr old male who is turning 15 pretty soon. About 2 years ago I told my mum that I think I might have depression and I want help. So then I went to my local GP and they referred me to see a counselor. I went to see my counselor for about 3 weeks then stop going as I hated talking about my problems because I could have lived my life without going back to those shit memories. I would have anxiety attacks during the session too. For the past year and a bit, I've stopped going to school because whenever I go there or go out, in general, i get anxiety attacks and I hate it. Because of that recently a bloke from child services came to see me and talk to me (to see if I was depressed or had anxiety). I spoke to him I filled out all of his forms, there was a box saying \"Have you ever self-harmed\" and I ticked yes. I don't know but that seems to be an obvious sign that I'm not okay! Just about 20 minutes ago they rang my parents and said that there's nothing wrong with me, I'm not depressed and I don't have anxiety. I'm so confused because why would I cut my wrists try to kill my self and have panic attacks often if I was okay? I'm thinking of hanging myself in my bedroom so I either die and stop living this hell people call life, or something will go wrong like the rope breaks or someone walks in then they will truly understand that I'm NOT OKAY. Thank you if you've read this far. I just needed somewhere I could rant about this. :(New Update:This morning my mum told me that her and my dad were splitting up which sucks especially when before they would shout at me saying that I'm tearing this family apart and now this happens. Which is great knowing that I broke my family because I'm a depressed fuck. Also, a letter came yesterday or day before about me and it was the people in control of counseling and deciding whats wrong me (i don't know the official name sorry). In the letter, they said I am not depressed or have anxiety and blamed everything on me playing video games until like 4 am and they want me to go to a place (30 minutes away) where they will help me sleep? I know they won't give me sleeping pills because I wouldn't need them. But they won't give me any counseling or a therapist. The worst thing about it is that I opened up to them telling them most things about me and how I feel. Then they tell me I'm not feeling any of this and I'm lying or a massive pussy. So I think suicide may be the best thing that could happen right now, my family can stay together and those people who told me I'm not depressed or have anxiety I can show them that they cant detect textbook signs of depression and anxiety. Every day I cut a new line into my wrist so I can keep track of how long it takes for someone to actually care. Again I just needed somewhere to vent, you don't need to respond. But thank you for taking the time to do so.Edit: I'm going to stop trying to get help now and just deal with it on my own.",

However, I believe I have social anxiety. Although it is not severe, I think it does get in the way of me living my life. I think that bullying and being isolated has contributed to this. I fear getting a job because of all the interaction I have to do. I'm short-sighted but I choose not to wear my glasses so that I can't look at people. I find it hard to go to closed and crowded places like fast-food restaurants by myself. The only people I can talk to normally are the four members of my immediate family which means I struggle to make conversation with my other relatives (they are similar to strangers in my mind). I have had friends but they were only 2 at most at any one time and almost all of them moved on or were just sticking with me because they had no one else and so stopped contact when they made new friends at new places. I think that a major part of my anxiety is the fear of not knowing how the other person may react and I want to be soon as a good and nice person and I apologize too much. After a lot of bullying and living in a village where the people did not have a good vibe towards people of another race, I went to a good university to do Biochemistry. I thought I could get a fresh start and make new friends but my jaw locked, I couldn't speak properly, palms sweating, heart racing etc. I could not get along with my flatmates and eventually gave up. Now I have graduated, I have no interest in anything and I have no dreams or goals to work towards and I don't have a job. I find it hard to even apply for certain jobs as just thinking about the role makes me feel anxious. But my mum is struggling to make ends meet. A lot of things have happened and I can't seem to stop thinking about dying. But I'm scared of doing it and what comes after. It gives me the same anxious feeling. I'm trying but I don't know.

I'm now at a quarter of the book and I don't understand the story anymore because I keep forgetting how people are related to the main character.Because of this, I keep reading \"easy reads\", so thin books that don't have a lot of different characters, or fanfiction. But I also want to be able to read more complicated books! I also have this problem when I am reading in Dutch (my native language). It helps when I read some summaries of the book before I start reading the actual book, but sometimes there are still characters not mentioned in the summary I forget (and I also want to be able to read a book without constantly having to google characters or look at my cheat sheet). And if I've already seen the movie/tv-serie I can also follow the story better (even if it's a different story, like when Game of Thrones hadn't caught up with the song of ice and fire), because then I already know the characters/world.Does anyone have the same problem, or some tips on how to get better at reading more complicated books?",

So from, 9/10 until now, I haven't touched a book or finished it, even if I was enjoying my reading because it was for school and not for me.

Let's buy some new books that you're interessed in and that's all ?Almost.. Thing is, I had the idea of reading in english to improve my vocabulary.

I don't want anyone to find out I shaved, and I unwanted facial hair I have bits of it, I don't want it to fucking grow, I hate how I look, I didn't ask for this shit on my face.

Hi all, I'm looking for some guidance here.On a subreddit I post on recently, someone made a post that indicated they wanted to commit suicide. It was not a specific, very urgent threat, but it didn't feel trivial either. Their reddit history indicated they've been thinking about this for some months.The default reaction, including mine, was to say 'Please get help' and post suicide prevention hotline numbers and websites. My own specific wording was as follows:your life is valuable. Please find the help you need. Others want to help you and they have helped others like you before. {Links to hotlines in OP's country}However, I then came on here to read advice, and am worried that I said or did the wrong thing and that that default reaction is unhelpful after reading the sidebar . Is what I/we said and did what is meant here when we're advised to \"Avoid advice and solutions\"? What would a better response have been, in case this come up in the future?Many thanks for any help or advice you can offer.",

This doesn't exactly feel like the correct subreddit for this but I figured some people here would have first hand experience. I live in California. I've been in therapy with a LCSW for a short period of time now. My suicidal ideation is sometimes discussed but I have not been open about the fact that I do have access to a gun in my home (it belongs to a family member and is unsecured thus accessible to me). This is really eating at me because suicidal ideation is something that I have struggled with over many months, even years now but with more regularity and intensity in the past half year. I know that I need help managing it. In my ideation, the gun is my method of suicide; however, I don't exactly feel suicidal currently...? In fact, I have never tried to harm myself before nor am I actively planning an attempt. But I frequently desire death, feel extremely depressed, and fantasize about killing myself. I also often fear that I could and would/will kill myself.I don't know what to do. I really want to be open about the gun and my troubling thoughts but I live with my family and am TERRIFIED of them finding out about my mental health issues and suicidal ideation. I recently came across a news article about a California man's guns being confiscated because his wife was voluntarily committed for mental illness (this occurred in 2013 though). I guess my fear is that I'll be committed too or that law enforcement will attempt to confiscate my family member's gun. In either scenario, my family would undoubtedly learn of the situation and I just so desperately want to avoid that.Do you have a similar experience? Do you know what the protocol is if a patient reveals a plan and means (being a firearm), but not necessarily active or immediate intent? What is the likelihood that law enforcement would attempt to confiscate the firearm?*might post to multiple subreddits",

I'm past my bed-time, and I just can't give any fucks right now, I want to die already. I wish I never existed. I wish this shit never fucking happened to me. I didn't deserve any of this 6 years ago, and I don't deserve it now, and there was no reason for this shit to happen to me.",

I know it's my fault that I'm broken and weird and isolated. I withdraw because I feel overlooked and unloved but you can't reach out to a liar that acts like everything is fine. And no one is going to ask you if you really are ok if you're hiding in your house. You hope someone will just fucking hug you and say they just at least see you. I act like I don't want attention because it's embarrassing to admit you need it. I've never really asked and now it's too late. I have had friends over the years but I've always been a tier two friend. Most I've lost touch with and no one missed me. My only friends left see me as the loser, the only one of my friend group that is not married and/or has kids. I've always known eventually they'd outgrow me but it hurts a lot anyway. It's slow but the world seems worse every day . No one really needs or wants me and it's hard to not make the connection that I'd be unmissed if I checked out early.

I had scouted my area for places to hang myself for weeks now, and thought I found an adequate spot now. So I went there, past 2am, with my rope to end this misery. But upon arriving, I've noticed that the path leading to the place I was heading to was not lit by street lamps. Already gave me a bad vibe, but okay, time to turn on the torchlight on my phone. After a few metres in, I got spooked really bad by a tree I mistook for some slendermanesque man, and after catching my breath, by some animal in the bushes. That was to much for me, so I went back home. Everything seemed so unreal, like a real life psychedelic horror movie until I got back home. I'm a bit dissappointed with myself, as killing myself would be the best way out of my misery. But it's not really easy, if the sorrow and neuroticism that consumes you transfers into your suicide plans and makes you fear failure to off yourself on the first try. I'm not even depressed or feeling sad right now, I'm in a pretty neutral state of mind. But thinking about myself, suicide seems like the logical thing to do. I will now read into death by exsanguination, as for my bathroom is lit even at night.",

I've never felt so utterly alone.My life is going nowhere. Depression medication didn't help. I missed school again today, obviously, so that I could end this. This morning my dad came into my room and said in the most matter-of-fact tone, \"You know, you're going to fail out of highschool.\" I know, dad. I haven't got a future. I'm a waste of resources. A black hole. I suck away everybody's time, energy, and happiness. Nobody should have to deal with me.I'm going to hang myself.

      "text": "I miss my books Ever since I was a kid, I always loved reading. My great-grandmother was a Kindergarten teacher, and when I was born, told my parents that the most important thing was for me to learn to love books and read them at the first opportunity I could. Some of my earliest memories are of being very young and trying to make my way through Goodnight Moon, Cat in the Hat, and Go, Dog, Go! As I got older, I would get books for birthday presents, from Scholastic school newsletter ordering forms, and Christmas. A Series of Unfortunate Events was one of the first \"lengthy\" series I'd read when I was 8 or so, and that spurred me on to want to read even more. By the time I was 10 years old, my room was more akin to a library, with bookshelves overflowing with novels. As a teen, I'd moved onto reading things like The Hunger Games, the Divergent series, Nancy Drew, The Hobbit, and more. Now, I'm 20, and my love of reading has never wavered. I'd even gotten a new shelving unit for my books this year. And then hurricane Harvey happened. In the span of a single night, 20 years of book collecting was destroyed. More so my entire house. A few days after being evacuated, I went back to see the damages, and of course, it was all gone. Hundreds of books were water damaged and unable to be salvaged. It was numbing, at the moment, but I was still in shock. Today, I moved into my new home. It really hit me when I went into my new room and set up my bed and chair. The books that I'd always had weren't there anymore. The room is full, and yet, without them, it feels empty. I'm not sure if I'll try to slowly replace my favorites, or just go out and get an eReader, or what. But...I just felt like I needed to share that. Thanks.",

      "text": "So I think I'm going to finally kill myself. I've had suicidal thoughts since middle school which I've been able to suppress, but I think I'm going to act on these thoughts soon. I'm almost 27 now and I got nothing to show for it. My life has been failure after failure. I'm a college dropout, havent had a girlfriend in years, have no savings, I work a dead end job, I've gained 100 pounds just in this year alone, my meds don't work, therapy hasnt worked either. I thought things were going to get better. I left my old job back in April and did a partial hospitalization program for 2 months, but that ended too soon. The only thing it did was leave me unemployed and uninsured. Sure I learned some shitty coping skills but thats not going to fix my life. I got no idea how to fix my life or where to start. I honestly don't know what I want out of life. I feel so fucking lost. I hate the idea that I need to find a job and save money and buy a house and buy a car and have a family. Whats the point of any of it. I've looked for jobs and I've researched them and I have no idea what I want to do or where I want to go. I just don't believe any job will give me joy. Sure I like the idea of going back to school and doing things right this time, but I got no idea what I would go back for. Nothing interests me.The popular thing on reddit is to tell people to learn a trade. Well I'm so out of shape now, I don't think my body can handle it. Instead I'm biding my time working retail making 10.75 an hour which isnt even enough to pay a car payment. I just don't care anymore I don't feel attached to it or anything. I could go on and on, but I doubt anyone really cares. The fact is that I'm going to die and the world will move on and no one will remember me.I've been told if I start to feel like this I should go to a hospital, but I don't have insurance anymore, I can't afford it and they probably wouldnt keep me. I just feel like I'm having a full breakdown. It feels like the world is just passing me by and I'm just a spectator who's lost in it.",

While that may be true, I'm not seeking attention, more that I need to put my thoughts and feelings into words, and at least know one person read it. I want to die every day. Often, I day dream of the different ways of killing myself, and I'd say almost once a week I find myself with a noose around my neck. So why haven't I killed myself? Because I have a fianc̩ that loves me more than anything in the world, as well as two beautiful dogs, one a puppy that I've been raising since she was 7 weeks old. Not even the three most important things in the world can make me happy, but I stay alive because I can't bare to think of what will happen to them if I committed suicide. Having lost my mother to an OD at a young age, and my brother to suicide a few years later, I'm no stranger to tragedy, and I know how much it can ruin a person. I truly care about my S/O more than anything in the world. But, my hatred for living, and myself, has become stronger than my love for them I fear. Not that I don't love him and my pups, but at this point, my mental illness seems to have made this relationship kind of impossible. It has always seemed inevitable to me that I will end up killing myself one way or another. I wish so badly I could finally just do it. I'm such a fucking coward, I want to just end it so I don't have to exist anymore. I have no joy anymore. It's either constantly on the verge of having an anxiety attack at work, or laying in bed crying because I can't find anything that brings me happiness anymore. I think I might do it today.

I see no excitement, happiness, motivation, etc. in my future. Not later in my day that helps me get out of bed or later in life that I can look forward to \"pushing through\" these feelings.I wish someone or something could help, but it doesn't seem like that's ever going to happen. That thought is what keeps giving me suicidal thoughts. What's the fucking point if I'm so fucking apathetic that nothing is enjoyable? What's the fucking point if I feel anxiety and depression more than any other emotion? All I can feel anymore is anxiety, depression, and comfort.I just wanna feel like I whole, happy, functioning person. I don't wanna die, but living is fucking hard and I can't make these feelings and thoughts fuck off.Edit: Also, I don't understand suicide prevention. Shouldn't there be help for people who feel suicidal? Help that actually helps stop the suicidal feelings and thoughts, not just prevents them? I don't want to be stopped from killing myself, I want to to stop thinking about it, I want to stop being depressed, I want to stop being anxious over everything.",

My mind was set on ending my life i was not acting nor did i tell anyone what i was going to do. I took all of them in one go with water. I lay back and waited but nothing was happening about 20mins went by and i started to feel groggy then my vision went blurry with sharp flashing lights i thought it was working so i tried to fall asleep which i could not do, after a while the blurry vision was a lot worse i tried to stand up and felt like i was drunk unable to balance so thinking had done what i set out to do i forced myself to sleep thinking no way id wake up. Well i did obviously as i couldnt possibly be writing this if i had successfully completed the task i was absolutely gutted about the fact i was still here i couldn't believe it. I don't know why but i called my doctor and told them what i had done they made me an emergency appointment and still very groggy i went upto the doctors. They asked me what and why. I told them i didn't feel connected to anyone or anything i find it hard to start or even continue any type of conversation i feel nothing and have done for a very long time even towards my family girlfriend and children i am empty like there is nothing. So they phoned an ambulance and made me wait with him until it came. I went to the hospital and I was seen by a nurse who did some blood test which came back clear. They then sent for a cycirtrist \"sorry about my spelling\" who spoke to me and said they wanted to put me under the mental health team. I am typing this from a mental health home \"rest bite\" as they call it. The thing is i am still wanting to end my life i have got to the end of my line i just don't know how to do it right using pills did nothing.So as soon as i get a chance i am going to go to a high bridge and jump. I just wanted to put this here as i feel i owe my family an explanation of why. I just want them to know it is nothing they have done and tbey really have tried to help me but i know now nothing can help me feel. I would love to feel anything even pain hurt but i dont and can't remember the last time i did. I am sorry to do this to you all. By the time you have found this i should be long gone and i want you to get on with your lives and not think about me just be good people do good things and remember only one thing i am at peace.",

I was on disability for a while, but when I moved to NV I was on medical marijuana. It helped. I was improving. Went two years without a single seizure. My migraines were under control. So, I thought...I'm young, I can rejoin the workforce. I was always an anomaly among my friends. I love to work. I love the satisfaction of bringing home a paycheck and paying bills. Before everything went to shit, I'd had two jobs since I was 15. Not because I had to, but because I liked it.Fast forward back to NV. I'm 23. I haven't had a steady job in years and I'm finally starting to see improvement. So, when my part-time side job lands me an interview in Ohio with a big-name company? Fuck yeah. I jump on it. But it all goes wrong.As soon as I leave NV, the migraines come back. I work for a year and a half. I make good money. Like...good money. Yay, money. But when the seizures start, that money works against me. I try to take \"lesser\" jobs. I consult, I end up back in retail. Anything to stay in the workforce. But when you have seizures, you miss deadlines. You're late. You're out for weeks at a time. I can't function when I'm present. I can't remember things I promised to get done. I get fired. I get hospitalized. I'm out of work.By 26, I knew I couldn't do it. I couldn't manage a \"normal\" life. I tried. Goddess, I TRIED. I tried until I was curled up in a ball in my bathtub with the lights out, begging for the pain to stop. Because I knew the moment I went to my doctors and said I needed the medication, I would be out. They've tried so many different drug combinations and they never work. Surgery scares me, but fuck, maybe I should just let them hack out parts of my brain.I reapply for disability. We wait. And wait. The System says that I worked for ___ amount of time, so why can't I now? The System says that I was too \"skilled\" a laborer, so I should be able to do \"unskilled\" work. The System says I'm too young to be disabled. I appeal. I reappeal. In the meantime, I try to work and fail. I appeal again. With no income and living with my boyfriend, it's too much. We move back to NC where everything is cheaper and my family lives. Thing is...in NC, I don't have insurance. I can't even get the medications that turn me into a zombie but keep my brain from becoming a country-fried mess. I start having seizures again. At home because ER visits are expensive.I try to go to school, thinking, maybe I'll find a career that will work with the disease. I can't make it through my classes. I'm stuck. My depression--something that...if you knew me, you'd think was impossible--is a silent monster, eager to lap up the agony of my 2-week-long migraines and the hopelessness in my heart.I can't keep doing this. It's exhausting. I'm so tired. I just want to rest. Without pain. Without the burdens I bring to the people around me. I'm . I'm hyper-aware that I'm home alone right now. I need help but I don't know how to get it.So I'm here. Hello, Reddit.",

He's really funny, we talk a lot, and I would consider us class friends. He often says little things like \"kill me,\" and \"I'm going to kill myself\", which alone isn't concerning because some people just say those things randomly. Today he got in trouble for drawing a dick on his desk. We were walking out of class together and he started talking about how he draws dicks everywhere. I half-jokingly said, \"are you okay?\" And he responded \"no I'm not\", also in a joking manner. Then he said he draws dicks everywhere because he \"wants to leave the school a gift before he kills himself.\" He says this all as a joke, but I feel like someone who talks about suicide this often isn't really joking. Some other things about him are he has ADHD and seems kind of weird if you don't know him. He told me he wasn't going to homecoming (which everyone at my school goes to) and if he did, he would just show up in his pajamas. Sometimes he makes jokes about shooting up the school too. I also like him, and maybe I'm just taking things out of context because I care about him.Are these things a warning signs? I don't have much perspective as Ive never been suicidal or known someone suicidal(to my knowledge). Should I do anything or just ignore it? I don't want to overreact to a joke but I also don't want to regret not doing anything if he hurts himself.",

My family are estrange to me because I am a failure. I have been coming up with plans of way to just end it...The one thing that has been stopping me is my rescue dog that we got little more than 3 months ago. He's a good boy..

Now I really enjoyed all 3 of these films, I missed all of these films in theaters and had to wait for a Blu-ray release to watch each film. For each film, between its theater release and Blu-ray release, I head nothing but praise, calling these films masterpieces, some even calling this films some of the best of the decade. When you heard that for months, and see a movie, even if you really liked it, it can be very disappointing. What films have left you disappointed to due hype culture?",

I try to stay strong, after all I was raised to be a soldier. I know i made a lot of bad decisions. In my life. Im 23 and still live with him but its taking me so long and im unable to afford to move out. I was made to drop out of school(or might as well have i went enough to avoid truency) at 15 and pay rent. I did sell by selling drugs and started myself on a path towards death or prison. I selled a lot and should have died one of the times i overdosed. Than i quit everything the day i found out i was going to be a father. I tried to get a job for 2 years relentlessly. Eventually the mother left me and moved in with some guy she met online taking my daughter along.(shes still unemployed to this day) finally last year i got a dishwashing job that ive been holding. Ive been trying so hard and doing so little. I sit in my room hating the fact that i still live here. Have so little accomplished, i hate that as i type this i cry about him beating my mother knowing i can't call the cops because every fucking time they never arrest him and i get hit more. I hate that i cant do anything. Ive switched to much self medication with mindful meditation but the lack of attention makes this difficult. I hate the feeling that I'm not going anywhere. I hate that i have noone i can talk to. I have 3 friends who just tell me they're sorry and i dont deserve it and i love them dearly, but sometimes i feel i should just quit Like it doesnt matter. Like the world would be better off without me.i have this sickness where nothing feels right. I have this pain inside hoping someday soon I'll die. If it were an accident itd be a travesty unlike a suicide wich is just a free sympathy ride for my parents that dont care if i do the right thing as long i got money coming in its not like im trying the best i can but i was raised to be a criminial livin in a civil world. Its surreal. In other words i cant fucking take it. Im paitently waiting for the day that i can say its not my fault.i didn't wake",

Prior to reading these, the only other work by Bellow I had read was Ravelstein, which I loved. I was really impressed by the last of the three: The Adventures of Augie March. It was around the same length of the other two books combined. Actually no, it might have even been twice the length of them combined, but it never felt like a slog to get through. It flowed so well. I could have kept going with the story, and when I was done it left me wanting more. I've went ahead and ordered the other two collections from the same publisher, as well. Augie's story really resonated with me, and not because we have any similarities at all. We really don't. But his was a story of love and tragedy, and who can't relate to that? My favourite quote from the whole book was: “We took the coal-and-ice dealers into taverns and drank beer and swapped talk, in those sleepy and dark with heat joints where the very flies crept rather than flew, seeming doped by the urinal camphors and malt sourness, and from the heated emptiness and woodblock-knocking of the baseball broadcast that gave only more constriction to the unlocatable, undiagnosed wrong. If you thought to something outside, it might be Padilla theorizing on the size of the universe; his scientific interest kept the subject from being grim. But in such places the slow hairy fly-crawl from drop to drop and star to star, you could pray the non-human universe was not entered from here, and this was no sack-end of it that happened to touch Cook County and Northern Illinois.\"",

My girlfriend broke up with me a month ago, and after a pretty turbulent breakup (still talking, meeting) I decided to stop talking and I was happy with that and things felt better. I got into drugs a few weeks ago, not because of her, but because I'm easily persuaded. My life has gone down hill so much in the past few years. I have become so depressed and anxious. I'm currently laying in bed after staying out all night with people I hardly know, and now I'm feeling extremely paranoid and depressed. My thoughts are scattered. I can't currently see any friends in my life that would talk to me about my problems. I can see my life spiralling out of control. I need to talk to someone who will listen, because I'm usually the one who listens to people. I have no one. No one understands what I'm going through. I'm not sure I really want to do this life thing anymore. The way people talk to me, about me, about the way I am ; it's all building up and right now I believe I'm at the lowest point in my life, which will obviously keep getting worse. There's so much on my mind, I'm losing my family , I'm losing weight, I'm becoming more angry, this is the worst feeling. Friends and family are going. And this isn't anything to do with drugs, this is literally my thoughts most evenings. So so so so much is going through my mind, I have no happy thoughts. It feels like I'm seeing things and situations for what they really are. I don't have all these feel-good chemicals in my brain to mask the mundane life that is reality.

I sound like such a child but it is so incredibly unfair.I think I'm mostly angry because I've really begun to realise how short life is and that we are in fact incredibly mortal; I hate the way the world is but what I hate even more is that I'll miss so much after I die. The complete lack of control we have over when we die and how much time we have makes me want to kill myself because at least then I can be in control of it. I don't feel in control of anything anymore, I just want it all to stop.",

The main books on my reading bucket list are Don Quixote and One Hundred Years of Solitude in Spanish, War and Peace, Brothers Karamazov, Ulysses, and then I guess whatever Pynchon and Kafka I could squeeze in. I doubt I would be able to finish them all and that would make me sad :( but I would give it my best shot! I also think I would probably end up revising my to-read list with some meaningful non-fiction, poetry, etc that just isn't on my radar now.",

It's been 5 years since I first attempted and failed and I know the only reason why I cowered at the last minute was that there wasn't someone there to jump with me. Am I a romantic at heart? Wanting to add tragedy to my short, misled life? Perhaps. Am I a coward? Most definitely. My mental illness has followed me across life and I can no longer bare to exist with it. I have received attempts of help in many forms but it's gotten to be an embarrassment for me and my family now. Their daughter with a formerly bright future has only wasted their hard earned money and I feel only shame for what I am. My attempts at being independent only landed me in hospital and my attempts of being a student or employed led to me having a psychotic episode and I had to quit both. I wish I didn't want to achieve. I wish I didn't care. I am now a 22 year old woman in debt with no degree, no qualifications and no prospects. My beauty is also fading and this one thing I could say I had will be no more. Some people just aren't meant to be on this earth. I wasn't meant to survive. The only reason I survived was through modern science. By the process of natural selection I should have never existed. I try every day to show my worth in some way but all around me I can only see the drain I am having emotionally and financially on their lives. I have been given pills of all nature and they only lessen the pain by 20% at the most. I am in therapy and have been for years. I exercise daily, I eat well, I push myself to do things the voices tell me not to every single minute. I still fail. I've tried enough now. I just wasn't meant to be here.

      "text": "In the first place, please excuse my grammar and mistakes, I'm romanian and rusty with english. So... it all started when my best friend committed suicide together with another common friend of us ( 15 and 17 years old ). They jumped off of an high building. And I saw the video from the police officers. He was ready to jump, started to run, then he stopped... he just stopped at the edge of the building and tried to get back on the roof but he slipped, he.. what's the word... he tripped over the building's border. This happened in 2015. And to this day I still think and cry about it. I often just imagine how is it to feel in the last moment that you don't want to die actually and try to save yourself but you trip over the border and fall from height, what he was thinking about... his body was broken in two pieces. This is still haunting me. I swear I'm not a liar, but sometimes I can feel him. I can feel he's with me, he's here, I feel his presence. I had dreams with him and they seem so real. After this tragedy, I was raped. I was in the cemetery at my friend's funeral with some candles. It was a day of summer. I would like not to go into details because I'll start crying but after this shit happened my mom didn't believed me and she said if that really happened is because I don't believe in god and that's his way to punish me. My father did nothing. I was on my own.My friend who committed suicide ( the one with 15 years old ) had a little brother. Yesterday he committed suicide too at the age of 16... he just laid his neck on the rails and waited for the train to arrive. I can't get this out of my head. I just think how is it like to lay down there and feel the rails shaking because the train is coming. To hear the honk of the train and to know this is the last minute of your life. What's haunting me the most is that I think is my fault. Last week I got nervous out of nowhere and I was thinking something bad is going to happen. And in that night I had a dream with my best friend telling me \" don't let him come to me \". I didn't know what to do... I was stupid, freaked out, I just think I had a chance to stop this. To stop his brother from suicide. In that week I have saw him too, but not him. It was like... I was getting ready to get out and go get some bread from the store and when I closed the door and turned right I saw his little brother, his form, his shadow like because when I blinked it wasn't there anymore. I was thinking it was because of my dream I had and just imagining it. How stupid I am... I should have known that I need to talk with him.I've lost my good friends, the situation in my family is not good and I'm feeling lost. I have moments when I just sit at the balcony looking down and thinking \" what if i just go a bit closer to the edge and then just jump \" and things like this. I have problems with the paranormal too. They're rather evil and freak the shit out of me or just sad and moving things and doing minor things. I just don't know what to do and the thought of suicide is getting stronger. I don't want any antidepressants I just need some advice and ideas what to do to get rid of my shitty mood because then the \"bad\" spirits will go away too, I just know it because when I was little nothing evil has approached me, just small entities. Since I had this thoughts and mood my life is getting worse and I can't get rid of this. I have already set up my suicide note just in case of a breakdown and thinking about self-harming again but I don't want this I just want to be happy and I try but I can't. I have anxiety too... I just want some help..",

Usually I'd get anxious, and coward out, but this was just so simple for me. But someone found me hours later apparently. Iwas worried if I did wake up, my parents would be upset like when i was younger, looking for answers and crying. But really theyve just been chatting normally, staying with me before the doctors move me. I still don't feel any different, just empty, except for general anxiety. I had tried to mentally prepare myself for this, distraught parents, me crying, etc like my first attempt awhile ago. But its been casual so far. I actually prefer it.But I just want to ask: what exactly does involuntary hospitalization include? I was in outpatient beforehand, and all we did was group sessions, color, sometimes talk to a psychiatrist, but that was a childrens outpatient when I was 14, and now I'm 20.",

On paper i have a great life. I'm at a good college on a great scholarship in my second year, and im starting to blow it. Ive been depressed for a while but im slipping especially now that my (ex) girlfriend has been slowly drifting away from me. She finally dropped the bomb on me this morning and I shouldnt even be surprised. It was long distance and lasting really well but she just cant take my depression and constant negativity and sadness anymore. I know theres more fish in the sea and blah blah but im sick of waiting. im sick of waiting to feel better. everyone was so happy for me to go to college and its been hell ever since i came here. im surrounded by friends here and i have tons of friends back home. I have a supportive family. but i dont give a fuck anymore. I commute on the train a lot and some days i want to step just 4 feet infront of me so I can instantly die. I dont look carefully when i cross the road anymore. I have access to enough drugs to overdose on. I live near plenty of tall buildings. Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, all the pills theyve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms. I dont care about leaving everything behind because life has been pain for me about the last 6 years. I've seen like 10 different therapists and my apathetic negative attitude has never changed. Im smart but being smart doesnt mean shit. i have no work ethic or motivation for anything in life. I just picture everyone at my funeral being sad and thats one reason to stay alive.. i dont want to hurt the people around me. but why should I go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced? Fuck college. I'm undecided major and im mentally checked out of al of my classes. i can just imagine some stupid fucking candle light vigil they would do for me to raise suicide prevention awareness or whatever. fuck this world. my brain has never stopped being paranoid, anxious, upset, and unhappy. everytime im happy i realize im just faking it and putting on a facade for everyone else. ive reached out to friends and family about how i feel and they truly do care but im too far gone to help. one of these days ill be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger. figuratively / literally . i guess im just posting this because im too afraid to tell people the absolute truth except for a bunch of strangers on the internet",

My home life is okay, but my days consist of the same bland routine of getting up around 8-10 doing my morning wake up bullshit, going and feeding and cleaning up all my animals and then sitting on my computer because my fiance sits at his and I'd like to at-least be around him for most of the day... I feel like absolute garbage, I'm exhausted, I don't feel like I'm loved or cared for my B.E.D has gotten bad again, i'm noticing myself going to the kitchen a lot more frequently and I'm now having to focus on fighting the urge to eat all of my feelings. I feel extremely sad.. unbearably sad.. Life is getting harder and harder for me to to endure on a daily basis. I want to just crawl into bed, lay on a heating pad and cry.. I contemplated suicide heavily for a few nights these last few weeks. I started to suffocate myself but got extremely scared, and was fearful for how my fiance would be had he found me like that... I couldn't begin to imagine the damage it would do to his heart... I know he loves me, I know I have some family that cares deeply for me... But I don't feel loved.. All my brain can focus on are the negatives, and how he looks at his computer 100x more than me, how he spends most of his time on the computer... how I can't ask for attention without feeling like absolute trash, or without him pushing me off because \"I'm not in that kind of mood right now baby.\" Which I get told probably every day.I feel like he's emotionally unavailable in some ways also, but he'd deny this even if it was completely and totally obvious. He gets snappy without even realizing it and that makes me feel even worse, then he'll get mad cause I stated that he got snappy.. etc.. I know I'm doing a good amount of non-sense rambling right now, I just feel like I've got to get it out to at-least you guys.. even if no one answers I'll know I let someone know.

I am so tired of feeling unmotivated, and unhappy.

My heart is broken in a million pieces and I can't put it back together. I want to so badly feel loved, and happy and emotionally stable for once in my life.. I don't know what else I can possibly do. I'm sorry for all this.. I know I am all over the place.. I'm just so fed up with everything.. Thanks for reading.",

And I'm not talking about \"I hate my life, I wish I was dead, I'm worthless, I'm stupid, I deserve to die, etc\". Those are horrible thoughts and I have those too, but I can more or less handle those because I've been living with them for so long it's pretty much normal for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a daily battle to live with those thoughts and I'm not trying to downplay them at all. It's just not what I came here to talk about. What I came here to say is that I cannot stop thinking about my family members and friends dying. Or people in general dying. I have such bad anxiety over it for obvious reasons but I can't make it stop. it would just absolutely ruin me, I know it sounds selfish and I'm an asshole for making it about me but I would honestly go fucking insane and probably go off the deep end and just fucking kill myself already. Or I'd just end up in a psych ward for the rest of my life. It's just something I'm not strong enough to live through.Every time my parents leave the house I'm so scared they won't come back. My brother is going to be an electrician and lately I've been having horrible thoughts about him being electrocuted and dying. I think about my best friend all the time and worry about her constantly. For her and my parents and pretty much everyone I tend to worry about car accidents because I think that's the most common way to die. I'm especially afraid of my mom dying, she's one of my best friends. Besides that I worry about animals dying too, like my cat and my dog. I love my dog to death but he is a dumbass who runs after cars when he sees them (yet he won't go near water) and that's just a recipe for a dog dying. And my cat is usually outside and I always worry that she'll get in a fight with an animal and die. Or that some asshole will hit her with their car. That happened to my kitten when I was 10. I just saw a picture of a cute dog all happy with a bunch of people around and I just thought \"what if someone shot him or threw things at him or something?\" It just goes on and on and on. I have loads of family members I worry about on a daily basis. It's a fucking nightmare that I can't wake up from because I always see horrible images in my head of my loved ones dead bodies, and I see myself standing around their casket at their funeral and bawling my eyes out at the hospital and think of the ways I'd kill myself if it ever happened. I want to die so so so bad, I don't want to live with these thoughts anymore, I don't want to think these things, I just want to drink and take pills and smoke. not to die. Just enough to make the thoughts go away. I'm so scared every day. I can't fucking live this way but I have to because I'm not going to kill myself no matter how badly I want to. I don't want to put anyone through what I'm horrified of going through. Besides, I'm too scared anyway.If anyone reads this, thanks for listening.",

      "text": "Just here to share my (long) story and hopefully get some real advice... I'm 25, live in a small town in Georgia, and have been contemplating suicide more days than not since 12 years old. 2 unsuccessful attempts. I don't have much family, nothing to do with relatives on either side (mom was adopted and dad's side live on the other end of the US and are part of an extreme cult-like religion). My dad's always been an absent, strung out, drunk, stupid, ignorant and uneducated redneck pussy. I love my mom and younger sister, but my mom passed away last year after fighting crippling illnesses and doctor fuck-ups for over 13 years. So I pretty much grew up without a mom, too. I've never had many friends or fit in around here at all, school or otherwise (I don't like religion or sports other than MMA). I tend to dislike or hate most people anyway. I did manage to find a good girl to be with, though, and we've been together over 2 years, living together for about 1 year. Her and my sister are the only reasons now I don't just stick my .45 in my mouth and pull the trigger.I've read all the self-help shit, tried it all, read posts here there everywhere, tried talking to people/loved ones (they didn't understand/didn't know what to say/judged me). I've tried drugs, got off those because they didn't help. Started drinking heavily after mom died. That was the lowest, darkest point of my life so far but I'm sober now. I've heard it all... \"Why are YOU depressed? You have nothing to be depressed about!\" \"I'm so sorry, I wish there was something I could do for you...\" \"Sometimes you just gotta be a man and suck it up! Things will get better when you make them better!\" \"Write stuff down, make a bucket list and just start checking that shit off.\"I've really, honestly fought like hell to beat this shit. I feel like I've done almost everything I can to get things right with what I can control, and from the outside looking in you'd say I have a pretty good life. I'm in a good relationship, have a good (enough) job even though I can't stand the people I work with, make enough money to provide luxuries for me and my girlfriend. I have stuff, good health (physically) for now, hobbies (that I no longer enjoy), good credit, never been to jail. Hell, I've travelled recently and marked some things off on my bucket list. I can even afford to help others out when they need it.But I still feel dead inside and want to kill myself. This world depresses me, I don't care for politics or TV in general. Everyone's fake and trying to sell something. People constantly take advantage of my sympathy and generosity. I don't believe in a god/gods, religion is a tool for the corrupt to take advantage of and profit off the more simple-minded. Life seems pointless, nothing has a purpose, nothing means anything... But I think I've figured out why:Friends and family.They must be what I'm missing in my life. They're the most necessary thing for true happiness, right? I find myself getting jealous/envious when my girlfriend goes out with her friends or spends time with her family. We humans are social creatures, always striving for acceptance and a place to belong. Reasons to live. I used to think I was ok with being a loner, but I no longer think it's possible to live a happy life this way. So I've been thinking about moving out of state to somewhere I'll hopefully fit in better, maybe out west/northwest. I can't do anything about my family (or lack of), but maybe I can at least make some better friends somewhere else.Problem is, my girlfriend doesn't want to leave her friends and family behind, and I don't want to force her to make a choice between me and her folks here. I'll also miss my sister, although getting away from my dad will make it a lot better and maybe I can convince her to leave, too.I don't want to hurt my girlfriend and sister, I just don't know how much longer I can bear this... I'm headed toward being that 30 something year old guy who suddenly hangs himself for seemingly no reason.Any advice? Anyone who can relate? Please don't give me any of that sugarcoated feel-good bullshit, I've heard enough of that... And no, I haven't sought out professional help, but that's because I don't trust doctors. Most are in it for the money and don't give a shit about you, and fuck those zombie drugs made by evil pharmaceutical companies. Just looking for some opinions, please.And thank you for caring enough to read all this crap.",

Over the past 2 years ive struggled to find myself i feel lost. To make matters worse my fiance the only thing that has given me any sort of joy in the last 4 1/2 years recently left me to find her self. She also struggled with depression and recently I had to go take her to the hospital because she was going to commit suicide. (this was after we broke up) She has gotten better through therapy. She has also found love with another man that she supposedly hated for the longest time. Im glad shes happy but the fact she was so easily able to up and leave me without showing a whim kills me. I cant tell you how many times ive saved her from killing herself, I gave her hope and joy and love, We were each others first time, and all i can think about is her and why shes not here and that someone else is the one kissing her goodnight. We have had so much history together and everything was fine with our relationship when she left....she said she needed to find herself which i get but i always assumed she was going to come back...Two days ago I finally had to ask if she had feelings for this knew man...She said she did....I also wanted to know if we would get back together at some point....She told me she doesnt want me or to be with me... but we can still be friends. I dont think she realized how deep that cut Ive literally spent the last 4 1/2 years of my life trying to make sure shes loved and happy and safe. I have given up so many opportunities for her that she doesnt even know about......So this leads me here I have no idea where to go or what to do. I feel like i have no purpose anymore she was my purpose. I dont feel content with any idea of a career, I cant just go try to be with someone in my mind im still hers even though im unwanted...How can someone who says they are your best friend say they dont want you...I cant sleep because i wake up from nightmares about her having sex or kissing someone else...Every moment of my life i spend trying to forget and all i can think about is how fucking bull shit this whole situation is....Idk how to be a normal person i dont have friends beside family but there advice is to \"get over it and go fuck someone\" ....Reddit where do i begin to get my life back how do i get back to knowing my purpose or choosing a career im happy with. Right now mine drives me more and more to suicide. I currently dont think i will commit suicide but i feel the closest i have ever been which is scary because i used to go to the kitchen and grab a knife put it to my heart and just stand there until i calmed down enough to put the knife back. Sorry for how scrammbled my post is..It helps me to just say what i think right now.",

      "text": "Tired Alright I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. Literally nothing in my life is good, especially this year.I’m a 22yo male, socially anxious, depressive and paranoid since 13. Went for a med school for a year before switching to a business school last year. Now,I have no friends, well I had friends, but I think they dislike me, and they have never liked me or seen me as a friend. Sometimes, even the internet doesn’t like or care about me. Now I'm too afraid to contact my anyone because of that, and so I’ve been keeping all my problems to myself for the past many months, and I can’t do this anymore.Housemates hate me, starting on the first day I moved in I could already feel their hate, although some were still willing to be friends. But before I realized, pretty much all of them hate me now. Maybe someone has been backstabbing me, or maybe I really did something wrong without realizing it. Now I’m very very very (I can’t stress this enough) terrified of going out of my room.Used to be very close with my crush, but then she started talking very little, and none at a point, then told me she got a boyfriend half a year ago, broke up a couple months later, came back talking to me, and from her words I realized I was just a spare to her. Since then I have absolutely no emotion support.No working experience because too afraid to even ask if the stores are hiring and too busy trying to catch up with lecturesNot doing well in studies at all, either I’ll kill myself before I graduate, or I end up failing a few times, wasting my parents money to retake the courses before dropping out.No achievements or awards or anything like that, so even if I do graduate I'm probably not gonna find a job because no employers want a loser who does nothing but studying.Been feeling extremely empty, angry and suicidal because of everything going on as well as fear. Also going crazy because I’ve been talking to myself furiously alone in my room and having the urge to stomp my head into a mush (gross, I know) every day. To make things worse, I’ve been seeing things as lies. One example is that I tried going to a counseling session many times, but I always chickened out before I went in because I couldn’t stop thinking that not only would the school counselor not care about my problems, he might probably betray me in some way like telling everyone about it or reporting it and getting me kicked out of school. There’s a lot more than what I’ve mentioned going on (and they have been going on for years), and honestly, words can’t describe how I’ve been feeling recently accurately. I’m feeling very very anxious and I just want to end this horror. I’m very tired.Edit: typo",

I will certainly need much more time to process the book (and honestly a second reading) but I wanted to give my immediate reaction to the book in toto. But I think it would be unfair to the novel to pretend that any one person or any one review can sum it up. It’s 1,079 pages (and they’re big pages) long and David Foster Wallace uses every inch of them. So before diving into the meat and potatoes of my experience with it, my recommendation is this: read it. Go, find a real physical copy, and read the book. Hell, it may take you a while, you may take breaks, you may start over, but seriously, find a way to read it.The best way I can describe the focus of the novel is that it is about happiness. It is about our (Americans, though not exclusively) obsession and compulsion to be happy and to have purpose in life. It is about the lengths we go to to secure this; the oftentimes self-destructive habits and addictions we form, whether to drugs or to more seemingly harmless things — particularly forms of entertainment — in an attempt to achieve that happiness, that feeling of self-worth. It is no coincidence much of the novel relies upon allusions to Shakespeare’s .A plot summary would be totally useless and take forever, so instead I’m just going to describe some of my favorite parts of the book. I guess this is less a review and more an encouragement to anyone reading to give it a shot. I think sometimes its size and reputation turn people off — and yes, David Foster Wallace may be an incredibly pretentious writer (there are times where it is obvious he loves to hear himself write), but there is genuine value in this book, genuine insight, and it is plentiful.I first realized this book was going to be something else early on. Towards the beginning one of the characters is preparing for his last (he swears) marijuana binge. DFW writes (and while this technique isn’t original I’d argue he may have perfected it) in such a way that matches both the character and situation, regardless of the scene’s POV. This is in third person, but the style, syntax, flow, everything builds to create an almost unbearable anxiety while the character sits in his chair awaiting the doorbell. By the end (at least I found) you are practically begging DFW to make the doorbell ring, you want a conclusion that will satisfy this man. The detail with which he writes is unparalleled. Here, for example, you feel such restlessness because everything is described very intricately and repetitively, so by the end you’re as much in the characters mind as they are.That’s not to say the entire book is like this. Many of the reviews claim it is extraordinarily funny. It is. Between all the depression and obsession and anxiety are some absolutely absurdly ridiculous moments. In fact, the entire background and backstory can be classified as such. But these ridiculous plot devices, by the end, have been with you so long that they’re normal, and so the novel becomes both hilarious and somberly serious. As one character describes it: ‘mirthlessly funny’.This is a book of contradictions. It is both extremely long and surprisingly short. It both humors and depresses you. It is both a dense read and a light one. Perhaps the only consistent thing about is that you pulls you along. Soon you think in their slang (I used the verb interfacing to describe talking with someone the other day and, no joke, thought the phrase ‘eliminating his map’), identify (god, there’s another one) with the characters, and start seeing beneath the surface. You will reach your own conclusions about what the book means and answer the questions it leaves open in your own way, but this is a novel that stays.Maybe in a few weeks or after a second reading I’ll have more coherent thoughts, but it’s a powerful book. Far from being the pretentious display of intellectualism I was afraid it would be, it was surprisingly approachable. I earnestly believe it doesn’t require an incredibly high reading level, as long as you’re willing to look up words, and carries very simple but profound messages. I know it already has changed the way I look at happiness, both my own and in relation to our society.I’ll conclude by quoting what Madame Psychosis says to begin each of her radio broadcasts, as both an example of the style of this book and because I quite like the quote:And Lo, for the Earth was empty of Form, and void. And Darkness was all over the Face of the Deep. And We said: ‘Look at that fucker Dance.’",

      "text": "I wouldn't be doing this for myself. Recently I've been falling back into a depression again. I've been clinically diagnosed with depression for about two years now and as you may know it doesn't really ever go away, it just sort of subsides. I think this is due to all the returning stress in my life. With the returning school year I'm once again going to high school. My high school is a special high school in a sense that it's especially bad. Other schools threaten their students with the prospect of going there, and it's not even an alternative school. We consistently are beaten by all the other schools in every academic area and the majority of our teachers have stopped caring. This sense of apathy has spread to lots of the \"intelligent\" students (causing a chicken in the egg conundrum).With my return to my school people have started questioning me about what I want to do with my life. Typically I just shrug and say I don't know, but truthfully, I really like art. It is my dream to write and/or animate a television show but sadly where I live the only job prospects are meth manufacturer and meth dealer. This brings me to another problem, money. My family is pretty poor. I live in a one parent home with two siblings, one of which is very sick and may very likely die soon. My father has also told me that his doctor had told him that he won't live past 60. He is in his mid fifties.Thankfully however, my family has saved enough for college. Sadly, we can only afford a bachelor's degree for both my surviving sibling and I.My plan is to kill myself sometime soon, or at least before graduation so that my brother will have enough for a master's degree and then some. I genuinely don't see the bad side to this. I may even be able to make it seem like an accident so that he doesn't have to deal with the grief of having a brother for a suicide case (if I can't make it an accident I definitely won't bring this whole scheme up in the note, that's just poor manners).In a sense, I'd really be killing two birds with one stone here. I'd be giving my brother a better life, one that he deserves, and I'd be able to die happily knowing that he got out of this shitty situation.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm new to reddit and sorry if I'm doing something wrong here(please let me know). My life is so pathetic and I honestly wish sometimes I don't know why I exist. Since grade school, I was always the almost non-existent friend that somehow gets bullied when I hit the spotlight (for whatever reason). I've left school twice, to get home schooled and medical treatment/therapy. Ever since, I've always had a desire to be liked and \"known\" because of this. Whenever I see people I know having fun, being surrounded by many people, and exist in other's lives, I get extremely jealous. I honestly feel pathetic that I even get jealous because I don't even deserve to be jealous. Prior to transferring to my current uni, I was excited to start brand new and be part of the fun at such a prestigious university. Now I'm a senior and I'm still alone, with subpar GPA. I regret everything I've done this past year because I haven't done any impressive EC's, low GPA, and obviously no friends. I feel so pathetic that I couldn't achieve a high GPA when I had no social life to begin with. I'm aiming for grad school (PHD), but at this rate it's probably impossible because of my below 3.5 GPA. I constantly think about professors and grad students probably mocking me how I perform in class. I'm afraid of peers probably looking down on me. I'm constantly overwhelmed with fear when I'm at school. I was actually blessed to have a friend for a few months, but one day I was shut down by the friend because I was \"pathetic, weak-willed, egocentric, good for nothing\". This happened when I reached out to the friend when I was suffering with depression and anxiety. After that it has scarred me tremendously and I've became afraid to be friends or open up to anyone. Now I spend everyday alone. I've lost touch with all my friends from back home after moving. I can't stop thinking about how my grades are poor, the loneliness, and my self-worth. I honestly feel like I have no talent in anything and it makes me wonder what purpose I serve in this world. I really feel like a good for nothing, just like the friend said. I don't have (or ever had) anyone who would even care about me. I can't stop thinking about ending everything. Probably the only thing I would miss (holding me back) is my parents and boyfriend that I semi-trust. But I can't seem to have enough energy to continue and care about them. I probably am egocentric, because I pretty much can only care about how I feel and what I want. I can only seem to care about the happiness that will come out of suicide. I just really want to disappear..",

      "text": "Derozan's play style. *Originally posted this on the raptors sub but with all the attention Demar is getting today might as well post it here as well. It gives some more context on how Demar plays for people who don't get the opportunity to watch him consistently. With all the attention Demar has been getting on , I wanted to look deeper into his stats and see how he is able to be a top 5 scorer in the league without a 3 point shoot.His most common play types are: 40.9% of his possessionsContrary to popular belief, Demar's most common play is not isolation but rather the ball handler in the pick and roll which he runs more than 40% of the time. Compared to the rest of the league he is ranked 16th in points per pick and roll, averaging 0.97 ppp (points per possession). Interesting fact is that Lowry is actually the best in the league averaging 1.05 ppp probably one of the main reasons our offense is so heavy on pick and rolls. (Qualification= >2 FGA per game) 17.1% of his possessionsBased on these stats Demar is one of the best iso scorers in the league. Last year he ranked 4th in the league averaging 1.02 ppp putting him just behind Kyrie, IT & Dame. (Qualification= >2 FGA per game) 9% of his possessionsThis was by far the most surprising statistic for me when looking at Demar and was the reason I wanted to look through all his play type stats. Demar averages 1.13 ppp which puts him as best in the league (the next closest guard is Russ at 0.83!). The main reason he is so good at the post up is his size for a guard and his elite footwork. Based on how elite he has been with the post-up lets hope the raptors start to run more plays for him in those situations and increase his 9% frequency. Also for reference JV ranks 12th in the league at 0.9 ppp. (Qualification= >1.9 FGA per game)**Used 1.9 FGA as demar was just out of the 2 FGA per game criteria I used for the other play types. 8.8% of his possessions Demar averages 1.26 ppp in transition placing him 25th in the league. To qualify I included every player with more than 1 FGA per game and excluded players that didn't play in more than half of the games last year. 6.9% of his possessionsThis is obviously demar's weakest part of his game due to the lack of a consistent 3 point shot. Demar averages 0.95 ppp which places him below the 50th percentile. The league best with a min of 3 FGA per game is Otto Porter with 1.31 ppp. The one positive is Demar recognizes that this is his weakness and utilizes this play less than 7% of the time. Interesting Raptor on the list is Carroll who is somehow worse than Demar averaging 0.91 ppp, with the spot-up being his most used possession at over 43%. (Demar & Carroll's stats) (League Leaders) Demar doesn't have enough attempts to qualify",

I started dating my current girlfriend 2 years ago, we met online via a game and have been in a long distance relationship, though we've met up dozens of times and have stayed with each other for weeks at a time sometimes.Both of us have dealt with depression for a long time, and when we started dating she was the sole reason I wanted to stay alive still. It feels reversed nowadays; I still love her a lot and she loves me, but my depression has gotten so much worse since I started seeking help (which I gave up on because my life felt considerably worse when I started acknowledging the depression) and I'm an even more negative person now than I was back then. I think this may have pushed on to her and now we are just a rolling ball of negativity.It feels like it is going to push me over the edge to suicide, but I also feel that if I leave her I will be pushed over the edge to suicide because I don't have anything going for me if I don't have her. On top of that it would crush her and the guilt itself in that would just fuck me up. I don't know what to do. Should I just try and get over it and push through until it feels like it is getting better? Should I risk leaving her ending in a likely suicide for me and a possible one for her?

I have tried suicide 3 times but survived each time. I lost my job shortly after due to psychosis. A friend called me up 1 day as her friend was looking for casual help. I don't know what made me go but I did. I was offered a full time role instead and took it. It was a job in a departmental store for a fashion brand - retail basically. Fastforward to 4 years later, present day. I had slowly moved out job by job and after many things that happened and miraculously, I am now working in a famous tech company, earing so much more than I could imagine, surrounded by amazing people. I have everything going for me. But alot of nights, I burst into tears over what happened. I can't get over the shock of what happened to me. I have only told my boyfriend who then proceeded to break up with me over it. I should be happy that I have 'overcomed' something so big but why is it that I am feeling that there is no reason to my life, constantly crying etc. I have also developed bulimia in the last few years after the rape ordeal. I have never told anyone this. Last week I threw up so badly, and my throat was not only sore but I could taste my own blood. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I want to die. I lost my boyfriend - the love of my life, who told me I am not good enough. I can't trust humans esp guys. I am fearful of going out at night and rush home at 6pm everyday even years later. I can't stop taking sleeping pills with alcohol because I secretly hope I will be able to finally die. Tldr: Raped 4 years ago, lost my job. I am doing so well now career wise but can't accept what happened. Shared it with my now ex bf, who dumped me. Addicted to sleeping pills and alcohol because I secretly want to die. I have 0 friends and family. Suicide attempt failed 3 times.",

I was bullied at school for my stutter so i had no friends and still dont at this point in my life. But this summer was the best and worst summer of my life. For the first time i was happy i met a girl and she was everything i ever wanted but after a couple of weeks she had to move back to her country and that broke me. I started to not eat, not sleep and just wanted to be alone. That also caused my family to hate me. They wanted to help but id push them away. Now a month has passed by and i come to find out she has a boyfriend. The thoughts of suicide were strong before but now they are even stronger. For the past month ive had that feeling in my stomach of butterflies or wanting to vomit and i cant take it anymore. Ive cried almost every day and though im going to therapy the thought of suicide keeps growing stronger. I was meant to start my second year of university but i told them i need a year break because i cant get anything done. Ive stopped taking care of myself and i feel bad for my parents. Ive already written a letter to my whole family and my ex in case i were to pass away but i dont know what to do. Its a matter of weeks/months now i dont see myself going past 2018.I know this isnt as serious as others on this group. I just wanted to say that i know it feels shit but i pray to god that something good happens in the next fee weeks. I love you all and it makes me so sad seeing so many people with the thought of suicide every minute. It shouldnt be this way. I wish you all the best and i hope you give god a second chance and stay here with us a bit longer. Theres a reason why you havent done it and you need to keep on believing in yourself.

I still have another 2 weeks before my first paycheck and another month before my first big one. My only place to live is with my girlfriend. And she knows that so she treats me like shit knowing I can't leave. I treat her like a princess to not get kicked out yet I still get accused and yelled at for always ruining our relationship. Everytime we have sex I'm always doing things for her and we have days were I don't cum while I put in the time to satisfy her in multiple ways. She doesn't trust me and always thinks I'm cheating or I'm going to cheat just because I use to mess around a lot before we got together. I'm honestly at the point where I want to break up with her but I can't handle the consequences. I havent been this depressed in a while. I'm more depressed now than my last suicide attempt. Yet somehow I havent genuinely considered it. It's just that it's hard for me to see a future for myself. I always fuck up my own life. I fuck it up and I'm okay with it. I do things I know are going to make my life harder and I tell myself it's what I want. Just to please someone else. I'm so nice to everyone in hopes that good karma will come back.

He broke up with me because I just wasn't that good of a girlfriend and did some pretty mean things and things just didn't work out and he just needed space and didn't need my life in his hands (I threatened suicide many times in order to get him to stay with me, manipulative and shitty I know.. and I know better now). After a long time of crying and feeling suicidal myself I'm finally just okay about things between us. Today he told me he's been feeling so suicidal lately and the only reason he won't kill himself is because of his little sister. He feels so alone and feels like he has no real friends. His family sent his to a RTC for 2 years and he has this resentment towards his parents because they sent him away because he pissed dirty but not when he tried killing himself (so he knows it wasn't out of them caring about him). I told him so many times that I care about him and love him a lot still but he just doesn't feel it and believe it.In my communications class we learned about this thing called a \"love language\" and long story short he really only feels love through service (actions) and I really only feel love through affirming words. So for a long time we were just not sending love that is catered to each other because he would always show me but never really tell me and I would always tell him but never really show him. Okay so anyways, I want advice on how to show him I care and love him through actions, this was my first real relationship and i'm still rusty on what to do. I want him to not feel suicidal and depressed. ** How do you guys feel validated and loved through actions? what are some things people do that makes you feel good about yourself and life? **I know this post probably belongs in the relationship subreddit but I would never go there for actual advice and him (and I) being suicidal just felt like this was a good place to go, since I OFTEN post here on my main account and I just feel so comfortable expressing myself here (but also I do delete my posts after my episode goes away)thank you",

      "text": "Giving things a last chance. If it fails, it's over. I can't handle all this. Here is what i have to face everyday,Meet the hell that's my life. I am 15 years old and I've seen, done and went through too much for my age. Far too much to say i'm okay.At age 5, I witnessed my mother being severely beat by her ex-bf. Also, i saw the relationship between her and my grandmother quickly turn sour so add more violence. I saw my mother beat my grandma, and it was so bad i had to call 911 and the police officer had to lock me alone in a police car. And we lived in a ghetto area, so often times there was gang violence and regular shootings and breaking and entering. Additionally, since my mother was single i was left alone for hours at a time at a daycare, where i was regularly abused in a physical manner. Age 6, we move in with my mother's now ex-bf. Cue him regularly beating my mother, and his children doing the same towards me. Seriously, one of them fucking threw kittens down a two story drop. At age 7, i was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. This caused me to nearly fail the 2nd grade. I also had severe amnesia, causing me to forget simple things as tying my shoes, or remembering the months of the year, what time/date is was and such. At age 8, my condition got worse. I was a regular visitor at the hospital, and i could now detect seizures coming on. And since my mother became ill, it became very hard to work. Therefore, food became scarce, we didn't have power so we had to plug our fridge into our apartment hallway and such. And while her boyfriend was very rich, he REFUSED to help in any way. At that time, mom called it quits and moved out. Age 9, i was raped by a neighborhood teenager. He took me into a park area at our apartment behind a bush and had his way with me. And we got evicted, so we had to move again. My mother cut off the two closet people to us, making it harder. (My grandma because they were a toxic combination together, and my auntie for no reason at all) Age 10-11. Some good news is that i started to recover from my seizures. I also gained a little brother and a (step)dad who loves me exactly as a son. Also, the reason my mom was sick because of an allergy to potatoes. I think my mother had an issue with her left ovary, causing her to internally bleed out 4 liters of blood. I think it was cyst that burst, however i'll ask mom tomorrow to elaborate. I was also was blackmailed by a stranger over the internet to show my intimate parts and do stuff to myself. Age 12-14. My mother shows her true narcissistic colors. During this time, i was severely emotionally abused, and was beat once. Did i mention stepdad joined in once as well? I was told so many things, that i was worthless, abusive, manipulative etc. I was also beat often at my school, and had my nose shattered by a bully. I was sent into a deep depression and i became suicidal. My mother claims to have tried to find help, but ran away once they explained that since i wanted to die they needed to report to social services. Since they'd put 2 + 2 together and take me from her she fled. She claims she did because they laughed at her. She also broke down my door while threatening to kill me. 15+. I stand up to nmom so therefore i got promptly kicked out. She smashed dishes, told my 5 year old brother i was worthless and since my stepdad stood up for me he also gets kicked out. We came back a week later. I've confronted her a few times and she tried to manipulate me but it didn't work, as I've gotten very good at seeing manipulation. I also report her to social services, and since i'm trying to get out i reach out to my bio dad. Turns out he's like my mom so he tries to say lies to make him into the victim. He's a deadbeat and always has been. I also get hit by a car, causing my grades to plummet, and me basically switching personalities. Heck, it's legit hard to try and mop, or find something in front of me. I'm now hot headed and i get very confused easily. It's very hard to understand many basic tasks. I also got beat up by a bully again and now i have emotional trauma that's triggered by me being hit in anyway.Since i fail to get help, nmom gets some of her friends to poke fun at me with her twisted lies. So, real fun. I also recognize that i am bisexual and came out and also that i'm transgender which has been nothing short of hard. Because of me not transiting even after i told my parents has sent me into another deep suicidal depression. So, I've made another letter to my parents. I've got nowhere else to turn. I can't even get myself out of the wrong body. This Friday, i will give them a very detailed note of what i am forced to suffer everyday as trans and without support. So, here's the note...Mom, do you happen to remember a letter I gave you back in June, where I told you that I'm transgender? Well, here it is again but I hope I don't have to say it again. This will be the last letter I give you. Since I told you and dad, my mental health sharply declined, as I was not being supported at all through this. You could be forgiven the first time, but I hope you see how exactly this affects me every single day, however I really need you to see that ignoring my feelings is the WORST thing you could do. I'm not okay, at all, and I hope I can change that together with you. Here is my reasoning, and what you need to know about my emotional situation. Understand that this is the furthest thing from a phase. I was born with this, how and why exactly and I must get support now. - I often curl up in my bed, wishing how I'd wake up a girl tomorrow. I'm too exhausted about this to tear up about it. - When I look in the mirror, it stings me emotionally. I am not male, and when I see my male body in the mirror, it's like being jabbed through the heart. It hurts, as I do not belong as male. I am female, beyond a doubt. - I've been suicidal these past few months. I can no longer deal with this alone, and I can't live like this anymore. It's fucking hell. Ignoring me, having me suffer in silence is hell. I wish to end it, maybe then I'd be reborn as female, and therefore happy in my own body. Did I mention that the suicide rates among trans teens for 30 percent, and 42 percent for self harm? That's for a reason. - Did I mention I hate my nude body? Honestly, when I see my dick, or little mustache I always feel a jolt of pain go through me, reminding me of the situation that I was born like this. - Speaking of my dick, I hate that too. Since I'm female, I try to tuck it in, and make it feel somewhat like a vagina. When I do that, the burden goes away JUST for a little while. - The sole reason I like to do girly things like, cross-dress, wear makeup, gossip and such is because those are what girls do. It reminds me of who I really am, and helps me emotionally. - From the very start of puberty, I've always had a nagging thought I was a girl. I would cup my man boobs and imagine them as real boobs. I always felt like I should have female parts, and therefore be a girl. This isn't sexual at all, but actually a sign of gender dysphoria. - I'm extremely unhappy as a boy. It's miserable, as I'm a woman trapped in a man's body. Also relevant, it's been documented and studied that actors who play roles of the opposite gender actually have signs of gender dysphoria when they play as the opposite gender! - If I had one button that would turn my body completely female, guess who would press it? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that that. I'm very depressed too. Often I'm fucking miserable and I don't have the energy to do anything. I have many goals I want to achieve, but when my mind is crippled like this it's too hard. The reason why I spend lots of time on my computer, is there I can be totally seen as female. In my mind, being called Jennifer gives me a massive wave of euphoria and happiness. But, the reverse is true if I'm called Jaden. - Some habits I've developed are that I prefer to urinate sitting down, as hey that's not what boys do. In video games, I always pick a female character as I easily imagine myself, in that game as a woman. - I have constant fantasies about living life as female. Never EVER a boy. So, that's the end of what I have to say about my thoughts and feelings, for which I have suffered from alone these past few years. I know reading this will shock you, and I know you will need time to accept this but understand that I've been going through this alone. What is harder in the long run? You living in bliss, unaware of how I am, or helping me through this? This is not a phase, and I know it. This is also the hardest thing that I am still going through, and I cannot get myself out of this pit alone. If you are unsure, take this letter to a gender therapist who works with trans youth. The therapist will tell you exactly what you need to know, and the therapist is a licensed professional. And don't be afraid to approach me for advice. I know it's going to be hard, but we must help each other during this time. Also, another thing I suggest, why not ask some transgender people on the internet on what to do. Since they speak from experience going through what I am dealing with, it can't hurt and they can speak from my perspective. Remember, there is zero way I can be happy unless I receive support. But please, do not ignore this. This must be dealt with now. I'm desperate to transition, suicidal because I can't do so without you and too depressed and miserable even if I tried. Here is some of my advice. - Take time to understand and accept this. I know the loss of a son will be hard, but you lose the fake show of me being a man, and get to see the real show, starring Jennifer! - Talk to some transgender people who can speak from my point of view. They may not be professional therapists, but they can give you lots of helpful advice. If you are interested, here is the link. - Approach a therapist that works with transgender youth. I think you should give them this letter and see what they say. - I know this one will be uncomfortable for you and Dad, and he even said it but refer to me as Jennifer. Heck, that's the name I've already picked out for myself once I transition. Use female pronouns, treat me as a girl simply because I am. Remember, I am a girl but in a male body. I am female, no doubt in my mind. A gesture as simple as that would mean the world to me. It's the small things that give you away. Mom and dad, I know what you might think. However you are not knowledgeable about this subject, and therefore it would definitely be best to find a gender therapist who can help me, and educate you about this topic.As you can see, i'm not ready to give up despite everything. Not yet. But now, if i fail to receive support i don't know where i can go, and what i can do. I can't handle this. It's awful, the weight and trauma on my shoulders.",

      "text": "My first post on here, I promise you I'm not a troll, I just need to ventI'm 20. Had severe acne on face and back for years, stress on the word severe. Face is discoloured and has scars, back is covered in huge holes and keloid/hypertrophic scars left by acne. Tried so much to heal the scars nothing works. No point me even trying to get a girlfriend because when she sees me with my shirt of she'll probably vomit/be traumatised. Leg broke playing rugby in my final school year, had to get an operation and was bedridden for months, led to weight gain due to no exercise and couldn't study due to discomfort/pain. I couldn't catch up with the work I missed, got terrible grades, kicked out of school now I'm unemployed and havn't had a job that lasted more than 5 months in 6 years and I'm still living with my parents. I've had OCD for all my life and it got worse with more stress and now I can't even sit down for 5 minutes without it rearing it's ugly head again and again. I'm a virgin and I have only a few buddies left that I only see a couple of times a year. I tried to stay strong for years but now I'm at the point where I cry most nights and have contemplated ending it all but I can't do it so I just exist day to day waiting until I can sleep so I forget who I am for 8 hours. I don't even know what to do anymore. Thanks for your time",

Recently I've lost all motivation to do well in swimming, school, and anything that feeds success.... I think I'm depressed and today I'm feeling really low. I've been sad for a while. Today was the first day that the idea of taking my own life wasn't a bad one. I probably won't kill myself, but knowing that my brain some how got onto the topic of wanting to kms scares me and I don't know what to do. I'm so lost, I feel like empty. I have one really good friend but I think he's getting really close to my ex now that school started:/ All my other \"friends\" seem so fake and one dimensional and distant.
